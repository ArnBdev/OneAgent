# OneAgent Consolidated Strategic Roadmap (v4.2.2)

> **⚠️ Canonical File Notice**  
> This is the **ONLY** authoritative roadmap. Do **not** create additional roadmap variants (e.g. `CONSOLIDATED_ROADMAP.md`, `roadmap_v2.md`, `HYBRID_ROADMAP`, etc.). All strategy, release planning, KPI updates and status changes MUST be applied here. Creating parallel roadmap documents is prohibited and will be treated as architecture drift. A future CI guard may fail builds if a new `*roadmap*.md` file appears outside this path.
>
> Change Protocol: (1) Open PR with rationale + diff summary, (2) If adding/removing release objectives, reference supporting RFC or issue ID, (3) Update Immediate Action Queue status table accordingly, (4) Note significant alterations in CHANGELOG under "Roadmap Updates".

> Canonical roadmap superseding ad‑hoc/fragmented roadmap references. Existing roadmap & vision docs remain as historical context; this file is the single planning source of truth going forward.

OneAgent v4.2.2 has completed full canonicalization of time, ID, memory, cache, and communication systems. All cross-cutting caches are unified (`OneAgentUnifiedBackbone.getInstance().cache`), discovery and web findings use canonical cache with TTL/backoff and negative caching, and all agent-to-agent communication is routed through UnifiedAgentCommunicationService (NLACS-extended, memory-audited). Observability is enhanced with Prometheus mission gauges, error rate, and health aggregation. Release automation is now in place: tag push/create triggers CI/CD with verify (type + lint), UI/extension build, error diagnostics, and release notes from `RELEASE_NOTES/<tag>.md`. Lint/static enforcement is expanded (no-parallel-cache, prefer-unified-time/id). Technical debt and gaps are documented, and next steps are clear for backend, frontend, testing, and governance. Focus now shifts to: (1) Reliability & Observability depth, (2) NLACS & PlannerAgent intelligence, (3) Structured Error & Policy governance, (4) UI/UX platform surfaces, (5) Extensibility & ecosystem, (6) Performance scalability toward enterprise scale.

## 5. Thematic Backlogs & Acceptance Criteria (v4.2.2+)

### 5.0 Canonical Cache & Release Automation (NEW)

- All cross-cutting caches unified (`OneAgentUnifiedBackbone.getInstance().cache`)
- Discovery and web findings use canonical cache with TTL/backoff, negative caching
- Prometheus mission gauges, error rate, health aggregation
- Release workflow: tag push/create, verify gate, UI/extension build, error diagnostics, release notes from `RELEASE_NOTES/<tag>.md`
- Lint/static enforcement: no-parallel-cache (WARN for 4.2.2), prefer-unified-time/id
- CI/CD: npm cache, timeouts, error log tail, artifact upload

Acceptance:

- No parallel time/ID/cache/memory/metrics systems
- All caches route through canonical service
- Negative caching and TTL/backoff in place
- Release workflow passes verify, creates release, surfaces errors

### 5.1 Reliability & Observability (Expanded)

- Error Taxonomy Registry: `errorCodes.ts` enumerating stable codes; mapping function w/ unit tests.
- Histograms: HDR or bucketed; p50/p90/p95/p99 from canonical histogram object; no parallel stores.
- SLO Config: `slo.config.json` listing targets (latency/error budgets) + loader & validator.
- Alert Pack: `docs/monitoring/ALERTS.md` curated PromQL + rationale.
- Anomaly Detection (Phase 2): Z-score or seasonal baseline; emits structured `monitoring.anomaly` events.
- Stream Uptime & Health: Track MCP `/mcp/stream` NDJSON stream uptime as a gauge; alert when below threshold; expose in JSON + Prometheus.

### 5.2 NLACS & Intelligence

### 5.3 Planner & Orchestration

Orchestration (Hybrid + Proactive)

Patterns (User flows to support explicitly, using canonical services):

Planner (Strategic)

All agent-to-agent communication, including orchestration, reminders, and team meetings, is routed through UnifiedAgentCommunicationService, is NLACS-extended for natural language coordination, and is memory-audited for full traceability, auditability, and self-improving review (Alita evolution). No parallel communication systems are permitted; legacy adapters are deprecated and stubbed.

### 5.4 UI / UX Platform (Expanded)

Acceptance (Phase A minimum):

- Orchestration metrics table shows agent utilization and success rate derived from canonical events.
- Live stream viewer connected to `/mcp/stream` with reconnection and health badge.
- Domain selector in UI scopes views to a selected domain (work/personal/etc.) without crossing data.

### 5.5 Extensibility & Ecosystem

- Plugin Manifest Spec: Signed metadata file w/ declared capabilities, permissions.
- Sandbox Execution: Process isolation or VM boundary for untrusted plugin code.
- Version & Compatibility: Semver + capability negotiation fallback path.
- Marketplace Bootstrap: Static index JSON + publishing CLI; later dynamic service.
- Connector Framework: First‑party connectors for calendars, email, tasks, cloud drives; signed and sandboxed under the same Plugin SDK.

### 5.6 Performance & Scale

- Adaptive Sampling: Keep full detail for errors & tail latencies; sample high-volume successes.
- Clustering: Stateless MCP frontends + shared memory + distributed event bus (NATS/Redis candidate) — design doc & prototype.
- Cache Strategy: Multi-layer (in-memory + optional Redis) with TTL & invalidation events.
- Load / Stress Benchmarks: `scripts/perf/*.ts` harness + automated regression thresholds.

Acceptance (initial):

- Baseline single-node sustained ops/sec published and guarded in CI perf check.
- Adaptive sampling enabled for high-volume operations without losing tail/error fidelity.

### 5.7 Governance & Compliance

- RFC Process: `docs/rfc/RFC-XXXX-title.md` template; merge gating for major changes.
- Data Retention Policy: Configurable retention windows for memory categories.
- Audit Dashboard: UI pane sourced from audit log queries.
- Policy Engine: Declarative YAML rules for message content, PII redaction, export controls.

Quality Gates (expanded):

- CI guard prevents introduction of non-canonical roadmap files (any `*roadmap*.md` outside `docs/ROADMAP.md`).
- Lint rule/guard to prevent banned metric names and non-taxonomy error strings in monitored paths.

### 5.9 Life Domains & Privacy (New)

- Domain Profiles: Work, Personal, Health, Finance, Creative profiles—each a context compartment with separate defaults, capabilities, and storage partitions enforced via policy hooks.
- Consent Bridges: Default‑deny cross‑domain sharing; explicit, auditable consent is required to bridge data between domains (with taxonomy‑coded reasons).
- DLP Rules: Redaction and content filters tailored per domain; denial events captured in monitoring with `operation` and taxonomy code.
- Domain Switch UX: Explicit domain switcher in UI; automatic inference hints (e.g., location/home network) must still require user confirmation before switching.
- Audit & Residency: Memory audit trails carry `domain` metadata; per‑domain retention policies configurable via governance.

Acceptance:

- Cross‑domain leakage conformance tests pass (deny by default; explicit consent properly audited).
- Per‑domain metrics and policy counters visible in JSON + Prometheus; UI scopes to a domain without leakage.

All domain compartmentalization, consent bridges, and DLP enforcement leverage the canonical UnifiedAgentCommunicationService, with NLACS extension and memory audit for full traceability and review. Cross-domain communication is strictly routed through canonical services; legacy adapters are deprecated. Alita evolution ensures self-improving review and auditability across all domain operations.

### 5.10 Model‑Agnostic Routing (New)

- UnifiedModelPicker Policies: Route by cost/quality/latency per role; cheap model for casual chat, upgrade for complex tasks.
- Hot‑Swap & Fallback: Seamless provider swap with minimal downtime; fallback to alternate model on errors/timeouts.
- Telemetry: Record route decisions, MTMS (mean time to model swap), task success by model class.

Acceptance:

- Policy tests demonstrate correct routing and fallbacks; MTMS reported; cost per 1K tokens trend visible.
- No env‑driven shadow configs; all routing via canonical picker to avoid parallel model systems.

### 5.8 Research & Innovation (Stretch)

- Autonomous Improvement Loops: Agent proposes + validates code path enhancements.
- Semantic Regression Detection: Diff embeddings between releases to flag behavioral drift.
- Insight Ranking Model: Train lightweight model scoring emergent insights by impact.

## 10. Governance & Change Control

- Release Cadence: 4-week minor, 8-week strategic checkpoints.
- RFC Threshold: Any new public API, storage schema, plugin contract, or metric label addition.
- Quality Gates: `npm run verify`, smoke tests, perf baseline delta (<10% regression), security lint.
  - CI Guard: Fail build if a new `*roadmap*.md` appears outside `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- Definition of Done: Code + tests + docs + changelog + roadmap delta recorded.

## 11. Implementation Principles (Reaffirmed)

- Single Source of Truth: Augment existing canonical services; never fork logic.
- Derivational Metrics: Prometheus exposition remains read-only, no shadow accumulators.
- Stability First: Introduce advanced features behind flags where risk > moderate.
- Progressive Enhancement: MVP → harden → optimize → extend sequence.
- Measured Ambition: Dream big (emergent intelligence & autonomous optimization) while grounding each milestone with observable KPIs.

Next Up (short list):

- Anomaly detection prototype (operation latency Z-score events).
- Enhance entity extraction (model-based NER pipeline behind same service contract).
- Proactive Delegation Persistence Stage 2 (planned): Structured error code taxonomy for execution failures + remediation latency histograms (builds on current restore + snapshot stage).

## 13. Moonshot / Long-Horizon Initiatives

All moonshot initiatives, including autonomous refactoring, self-tuning planner, federated multi-agent mesh, and temporal analytics, are required to use the canonical UnifiedAgentCommunicationService with NLACS extension and memory audit for traceability and self-improving review (Alita evolution). No parallel communication systems are permitted; legacy adapters are deprecated and stubbed.

- Autonomous Refactoring Agent: Observes hotspots, drafts patch PRs with quality validation.
- Self-Tuning Planner: Uses reinforcement signals to optimize decomposition strategies.
- Federated Multi-Agent Mesh: Secure cross-instance collaboration with cryptographic capability tokens.
- Temporal Analytics Engine: Time-series correlation across memory, operations, and insights for causality discovery.

# OneAgent Consolidated Strategic Roadmap (v4.1.0)

> **⚠️ Canonical File Notice**  
> This is the **ONLY** authoritative roadmap. Do **not** create additional roadmap variants (e.g. `CONSOLIDATED_ROADMAP.md`, `roadmap_v2.md`, `HYBRID_ROADMAP`, etc.). All strategy, release planning, KPI updates and status changes MUST be applied here. Creating parallel roadmap documents is prohibited and will be treated as architecture drift. A future CI guard may fail builds if a new `*roadmap*.md` file appears outside this path.
>
> Change Protocol: (1) Open PR with rationale + diff summary, (2) If adding/removing release objectives, reference supporting RFC or issue ID, (3) Update Immediate Action Queue status table accordingly, (4) Note significant alterations in CHANGELOG under "Roadmap Updates".

> Canonical roadmap superseding ad‑hoc/fragmented roadmap references. Existing roadmap & vision docs remain as historical context; this file is the single planning source of truth going forward.

## 1. Executive Summary

OneAgent has completed foundational consolidation (time, ID, memory, cache, communication persistence, baseline monitoring) and delivered professional MCP + A2A multi-agent capabilities. All agent-to-agent communication is routed through the canonical UnifiedAgentCommunicationService, is NLACS-extended for natural language coordination, and is memory-audited for full traceability and self-improving review (Alita evolution). Focus now shifts to: (1) Reliability & Observability depth, (2) NLACS & PlannerAgent true intelligence layer, (3) Structured Error & Policy governance, (4) UI/UX platform surfaces (web, desktop, mobile), (5) Extensibility & ecosystem, (6) Performance scalability toward enterprise scale.

## 5. Thematic Backlogs & Acceptance Criteria

### 5.1 Reliability & Observability

- Error Taxonomy Registry: `errorCodes.ts` enumerating stable codes; mapping function w/ unit tests.
- Histograms: HDR or bucketed; p50/p90/p95/p99 from canonical histogram object; no parallel stores.
- SLO Config: `slo.config.json` listing targets (latency/error budgets) + loader & validator.
- Alert Pack: `docs/monitoring/ALERTS.md` curated PromQL + rationale.
- Anomaly Detection (Phase 2): Z-score or seasonal baseline; emits structured `monitoring.anomaly` events.
- Stream Uptime & Health: Track MCP `/mcp/stream` NDJSON stream uptime as a gauge; alert when below threshold; expose in JSON + Prometheus.

### 5.2 NLACS & Intelligence

### 5.3 Planner & Orchestration

Orchestration (Hybrid + Proactive)

Patterns (User flows to support explicitly, using canonical services):

Planner (Strategic)

All agent-to-agent communication, including orchestration, reminders, and team meetings, is routed through UnifiedAgentCommunicationService, is NLACS-extended for natural language coordination, and is memory-audited for full traceability, auditability, and self-improving review (Alita evolution). No parallel communication systems are permitted; legacy adapters are deprecated and stubbed.

### 5.4 UI / UX Platform

Acceptance (Phase A minimum):

- Orchestration metrics table shows agent utilization and success rate derived from canonical events.
- Live stream viewer connected to `/mcp/stream` with reconnection and health badge.
- Domain selector in UI scopes views to a selected domain (work/personal/etc.) without crossing data.

### 5.5 Extensibility & Ecosystem (Expanded)

- Plugin Manifest Spec: Signed metadata file w/ declared capabilities, permissions.
- Sandbox Execution: Process isolation or VM boundary for untrusted plugin code.
- Version & Compatibility: Semver + capability negotiation fallback path.
- Marketplace Bootstrap: Static index JSON + publishing CLI; later dynamic service.
- Connector Framework: First‑party connectors for calendars, email, tasks, cloud drives; signed and sandboxed under the same Plugin SDK.

### 5.6 Performance & Scale (Expanded)

- Adaptive Sampling: Keep full detail for errors & tail latencies; sample high-volume successes.
- Clustering: Stateless MCP frontends + shared memory + distributed event bus (NATS/Redis candidate) — design doc & prototype.
- Cache Strategy: Multi-layer (in-memory + optional Redis) with TTL & invalidation events.
- Load / Stress Benchmarks: `scripts/perf/*.ts` harness + automated regression thresholds.

Acceptance (initial):

- Baseline single-node sustained ops/sec published and guarded in CI perf check.
- Adaptive sampling enabled for high-volume operations without losing tail/error fidelity.

### 5.7 Governance & Compliance (Expanded)

- RFC Process: `docs/rfc/RFC-XXXX-title.md` template; merge gating for major changes.
- Data Retention Policy: Configurable retention windows for memory categories.
- Audit Dashboard: UI pane sourced from audit log queries.
- Policy Engine: Declarative YAML rules for message content, PII redaction, export controls.

Quality Gates (expanded):

- CI guard prevents introduction of non-canonical roadmap files (any `*roadmap*.md` outside `docs/ROADMAP.md`).
- Lint rule/guard to prevent banned metric names and non-taxonomy error strings in monitored paths.

### 5.8 Life Domains & Privacy (Expanded)

- Domain Profiles: Work, Personal, Health, Finance, Creative profiles—each a context compartment with separate defaults, capabilities, and storage partitions enforced via policy hooks.
- Consent Bridges: Default‑deny cross‑domain sharing; explicit, auditable consent is required to bridge data between domains (with taxonomy‑coded reasons).
- DLP Rules: Redaction and content filters tailored per domain; denial events captured in monitoring with `operation` and taxonomy code.
- Domain Switch UX: Explicit domain switcher in UI; automatic inference hints (e.g., location/home network) must still require user confirmation before switching.
- Audit & Residency: Memory audit trails carry `domain` metadata; per‑domain retention policies configurable via governance.

Acceptance:

- Cross‑domain leakage conformance tests pass (deny by default; explicit consent properly audited).
- Per‑domain metrics and policy counters visible in JSON + Prometheus; UI scopes to a domain without leakage.

All domain compartmentalization, consent bridges, and DLP enforcement leverage the canonical UnifiedAgentCommunicationService, with NLACS extension and memory audit for full traceability and review. Cross-domain communication is strictly routed through canonical services; legacy adapters are deprecated. Alita evolution ensures self-improving review and auditability across all domain operations.

### 5.9 Model-Agnostic Routing (Expanded)

- UnifiedModelPicker Policies: Route by cost/quality/latency per role; cheap model for casual chat, upgrade for complex tasks.
- Hot‑Swap & Fallback: Seamless provider swap with minimal downtime; fallback to alternate model on errors/timeouts.
- Telemetry: Record route decisions, MTMS (mean time to model swap), task success by model class.

Acceptance:

- Policy tests demonstrate correct routing and fallbacks; MTMS reported; cost per 1K tokens trend visible.
- No env‑driven shadow configs; all routing via canonical picker to avoid parallel model systems.

### 5.10 Research & Innovation (Expanded)

- Autonomous Improvement Loops: Agent proposes + validates code path enhancements.
- Semantic Regression Detection: Diff embeddings between releases to flag behavioral drift.
- Insight Ranking Model: Train lightweight model scoring emergent insights by impact.

## 10. Governance & Change Control

- Release Cadence: 4-week minor, 8-week strategic checkpoints.
- RFC Threshold: Any new public API, storage schema, plugin contract, or metric label addition.
- Quality Gates: `npm run verify`, smoke tests, perf baseline delta (<10% regression), security lint.
  - CI Guard: Fail build if a new `*roadmap*.md` appears outside `docs/ROADMAP.md`.
- Definition of Done: Code + tests + docs + changelog + roadmap delta recorded.

## 11. Implementation Principles (Reaffirmed)

- Single Source of Truth: Augment existing canonical services; never fork logic.
- Derivational Metrics: Prometheus exposition remains read-only, no shadow accumulators.
- Stability First: Introduce advanced features behind flags where risk > moderate.
- Progressive Enhancement: MVP → harden → optimize → extend sequence.
- Measured Ambition: Dream big (emergent intelligence & autonomous optimization) while grounding each milestone with observable KPIs.

Next Up (short list):

- Anomaly detection prototype (operation latency Z-score events).
- Enhance entity extraction (model-based NER pipeline behind same service contract).
- Proactive Delegation Persistence Stage 2 (planned): Structured error code taxonomy for execution failures + remediation latency histograms (builds on current restore + snapshot stage).

## 13. Moonshot / Long-Horizon Initiatives

All moonshot initiatives, including autonomous refactoring, self-tuning planner, federated multi-agent mesh, and temporal analytics, are required to use the canonical UnifiedAgentCommunicationService with NLACS extension and memory audit for traceability and self-improving review (Alita evolution). No parallel communication systems are permitted; legacy adapters are deprecated and stubbed.

- Autonomous Refactoring Agent: Observes hotspots, drafts patch PRs with quality validation.
- Self-Tuning Planner: Uses reinforcement signals to optimize decomposition strategies.
- Federated Multi-Agent Mesh: Secure cross-instance collaboration with cryptographic capability tokens.
- Temporal Analytics Engine: Time-series correlation across memory, operations, and insights for causality discovery.

## 14. Acceptance & Review

This roadmap is considered active once merged to `main`. Quarterly review cycle; monthly checkpoint updates appended in a CHANGELOG "Roadmap Updates" section.
