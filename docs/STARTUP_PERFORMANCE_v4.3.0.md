# OneAgent Startup Performance Optimization (v4.3.0.x)

> **Created**: October 1, 2025  
> **Status**: Complete  
> **Impact**: 90-110 second improvement in parallel server startup

## Problem Statement

OneAgent v4.3.0 had slow startup times due to blocking tool registration before HTTP server initialization:

- **MCP Server**: 90-120 seconds to become available (blocking on tool registration)
- **Memory Server**: Ready in ~4 seconds but had to wait for MCP
- **Result**: Both servers couldn't start in parallel effectively

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Tool Registration Bottleneck
```
[ToolRegistry] Processing per tool:
  1. 📥 Starting registration
  2. ✅ Registry initialized  
  3. 🔄 Loading cache
  4. ✅ Cache loaded
  5. 🔨 Creating metadata
  6. 📝 Building registration object
  7. ✅ Tools cached
  8. ✅ Categories cached
  9. ✅ Cache saved
  10. 🎉 Registration complete
  
12 tools × 10 operations × cache I/O = ~90-120 seconds
```

**Analysis**: Each tool registration involves:
- File system I/O (cache operations)
- Category structure validation
- Metadata construction
- Duplicate tool checking
- **Verbose console logging** (adds overhead)

### 2. Sequential Startup Flow (Before)
```
1. Load modules (3s)
2. Initialize OneAgent Engine
   → Initialize tools (90-120s) ← BLOCKS HERE
3. Start HTTP server
4. Show "Ready" banner
```

**Problem**: HTTP endpoints (/health, /mcp) unavailable until ALL tools registered.

### 3. Memory Server Health Check Issues
```python
# FastMCP /mcp endpoint behavior
GET /mcp → 406 Not Acceptable  # This is CORRECT
POST /mcp → 200 OK (MCP protocol)
```

**Problem**: Startup script used `GET /health` (doesn't exist) and `GET /mcp` (returns 406).

## Solutions Implemented

### v4.3.0.1: Health Check Fixes
**Commit**: `8ae94c4`

**Changes**:
1. Fixed memory server probe to handle 406 as success
2. Increased MCP timeout: 60s → 90s → 120s
3. Better error messaging
4. Updated troubleshooting documentation

**Impact**: Improved reliability but didn't address core performance issue.

---

### v4.3.0.2: Parallel Initialization (MAJOR)
**Commit**: `accbe02`

**Architecture Change**: Start HTTP server BEFORE tool initialization

#### Before (Sequential):
```typescript
async function startServer() {
  await initializeServer();  // BLOCKS for 90-120s
  app.listen(port, host);    // HTTP available after tools ready
}
```

#### After (Parallel):
```typescript
async function startServer() {
  const server = app.listen(port, host);  // HTTP available in 3-5s
  
  initializeServer()  // Tools initialize in background
    .then(() => console.log('✅ Tools ready!'))
    .catch(err => console.error('Tool init failed'));
}
```

**Key Benefits**:
1. `/health` endpoint available in 3-5 seconds
2. Tool registration happens asynchronously
3. Both servers can start simultaneously
4. Memory server doesn't wait for MCP tools

---

## Performance Results

### Timeline Comparison

**Before (v4.3.0)**:
```
T+0s:   MCP server starts loading modules
T+3s:   Modules loaded, starting tool registration
T+90s:  Tool registration complete
T+93s:  HTTP server starts
T+93s:  Health endpoint available
T+120s: Memory server can start probing
T+124s: Memory server ready
Total:  124 seconds until both operational
```

**After (v4.3.0.2)**:
```
T+0s:   MCP server starts loading modules
T+3s:   Modules loaded, HTTP server starts immediately
T+5s:   Health endpoint available ✅
T+5s:   Memory server starts (parallel with tool init)
T+9s:   Memory server ready ✅
T+93s:  Tool registration completes (in background)
Total:  9 seconds until both operational
```

**Improvement**: **115 seconds faster** (~92% reduction)

## Technical Details

### Startup Script Changes

**Health Check Optimization**:
```powershell
# Before: Wait up to 120s for full MCP initialization
Wait-HttpReady -Url "http://127.0.0.1:8083/health" -TimeoutSec 120

# After: Wait only 30s for HTTP server (starts in 3-5s)
Wait-HttpReady -Url "http://127.0.0.1:8083/health" -TimeoutSec 30
```

**Memory Server Probe**:
```powershell
# Correctly handle 406 Not Acceptable as success
catch [System.Net.WebException] {
    if ($_.Exception.Response.StatusCode -eq 406) {
        $memReady = $true  # Server is up!
        break
    }
}
```

### Server Logs (v4.3.0.2)

**Expected Output**:
```
🌟 OneAgent HTTP Server Started!
📡 Server Information:
   • Health Check: http://127.0.0.1:8083/health (available now)
⏳ Initializing OneAgent Engine (tools, AI, memory)...

[... 90 seconds of tool registration ...]

✅ OneAgent Engine Fully Initialized!
🎪 Ready for VS Code Copilot Chat! 🎪
```

## Future Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Reduce Tool Registration Verbosity
**Impact**: Moderate (~10-20% reduction)

```typescript
// Option: Environment variable to disable verbose logging
if (process.env.ONEAGENT_QUIET_STARTUP !== '1') {
  console.log('[ToolRegistry] 📥 Starting registration...');
}
```

### 2. Parallel Tool Registration
**Impact**: High (~50-70% reduction)

```typescript
// Current: Sequential
for (const tool of tools) {
  await registerTool(tool);  // Each takes ~7-10s
}

// Future: Parallel
await Promise.all(
  tools.map(tool => registerTool(tool))
);
```

### 3. Lazy Tool Loading
**Impact**: Highest (tools load on-demand)

```typescript
// Load only core tools at startup
// Load specialized tools on first use
```

### 4. Cache Optimization
**Impact**: Moderate (~20-30% reduction)

- Batch cache operations instead of per-tool
- Use in-memory cache for warm starts
- Implement cache versioning to skip validation

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Tool Operations Before Init Complete
**Scenario**: Client calls tool before registration finishes

**Mitigation**: Queue tool calls until initialization complete
```typescript
if (!serverInitialized) {
  return { error: 'Server initializing, please retry in 10s' };
}
```

### 2. Health Check Doesn't Reflect Tool Status
**Current**: `/health` returns 200 even if tools still loading

**Future Enhancement**: Add `/health?detailed=true` with component status:
```json
{
  "status": "initializing",
  "http": "ready",
  "tools": "loading",
  "progress": "8/12 tools registered"
}
```

### 3. WebSocket Connections During Init
**Scenario**: Mission Control WS connects before tools ready

**Current**: Works but tool list incomplete
**Mitigation**: Client should poll until `tools.status === 'ready'`

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: MCP Server Still Slow
**Symptoms**: HTTP server takes >30s to start

**Diagnosis**:
1. Check Node.js version: `node --version` (should be v18+)
2. Check TypeScript compilation: `npm run build`
3. Check disk I/O: Tool cache writes may be slow
4. Check for zombie processes: `Get-Process node`

**Solutions**:
```powershell
# Clear tool cache
Remove-Item data/cache/tools -Recurse -Force

# Disable tool caching (faster startup, no persistence)
$env:ONEAGENT_DISABLE_TOOL_CACHE=1

# Quiet logging (reduces console overhead)
$env:ONEAGENT_QUIET_STARTUP=1
```

### Issue: Tools Not Registered
**Symptoms**: Tool calls fail with "tool not found"

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check MCP server logs
# Should see: "✅ OneAgent Engine Fully Initialized!"
```

**Solutions**:
- Wait for full initialization (~90s from HTTP start)
- Check for errors in tool registration logs
- Verify tool definitions in `coreagent/tools/`

### Issue: Memory Server Can't Connect
**Symptoms**: Memory operations fail after startup

**Diagnosis**:
```bash
# Check memory server logs
# Should see: "INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8010"

# Test connectivity
curl http://localhost:8010/health
# Should return 404 (no /health endpoint - this is normal)
```

**Solutions**:
- Memory server is independent - doesn't need MCP
- Use `oneagent_memory_*` tools (they handle connection)
- Check GOOGLE_API_KEY is set for Gemini
