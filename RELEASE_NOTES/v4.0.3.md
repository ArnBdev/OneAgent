# v4.0.3

Date: 2025-08-17

Highlights:
- Consolidated model selection to UnifiedModelPicker (single source of truth)
- Removed legacy/parallel systems:
  - Deleted specialized AgentFactory facade and gemini-model-tier-selector
  - Neutralized legacy tier-system test (archived under tests/_legacy_archive)
- Base AgentFactory is now the only supported entrypoint
- Verified Windows runtime: typecheck, lint, A2A smokes, unified runtime smoke

Verification:
- npm run verify: PASS
- A2A events + discovery messaging: PASS
- npm run verify:runtime (unified MCP server + memory): PASS

Notes:
- ENV model names are deprecated; keep only API keys in .env
- Use roles via UnifiedModelPicker for provider-agnostic model selection
