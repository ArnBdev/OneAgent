# scripts/start-oneagent-system.ps1

This is the canonical PowerShell script for starting the production OneAgent system and its memory backend (Minne).

**Startup Order (Canonical):**
1. Starts the unified OneAgent MCP server using:
       node -r ts-node/register coreagent/server/unified-mcp-server.ts
2. Waits for MCP server health/readiness (sequential, not a fixed delay).
3. Starts the memory backend (Minne) using:
       uvicorn servers.oneagent_memory_server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8010 --reload

This script replaces all legacy/dev/CLI/test entry points. Use ONLY this script for production or development startup.
