## üöÄ Enhancement Roadmap

### **Enhancement 1: Adaptive Learning Engine**
**Goal**: Learn from actual usage patterns to optimize model selection over time.

**Features**:
- **Usage Analytics**: Track model performance by agent type and task
- **Cost Optimization Learning**: Learn which models provide best cost/performance ratio
- **Automatic Tier Adjustment**: Dynamically adjust tier recommendations based on real usage
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare actual vs. predicted performance

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface ModelUsageMetrics {
  modelId: string;
  agentType: string;
  taskType: string;
  actualCost: number;
  responseTime: number;
  qualityScore: number;
  userSatisfaction: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

class AdaptiveLearningEngine {
  trackUsage(metrics: ModelUsageMetrics): void;
  optimizeSelection(criteria: ModelSelectionCriteria): ModelSelection;
  generateInsights(): TierOptimizationInsights;
}
```

### **Enhancement 2: Real-Time Cost Monitoring**
**Goal**: Provide real-time cost tracking and budget alerts.

**Features**:
- **Real-Time Cost Dashboard**: Live cost tracking per agent/model/tier
- **Budget Alerts**: Proactive notifications when approaching limits
- **Cost Forecasting**: Predict monthly costs based on usage patterns
- **Tier Recommendations**: Suggest tier changes to optimize costs

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface CostMonitoringService {
  trackTokenUsage(agentId: string, model: string, tokens: number): void;
  getCurrentCost(timeframe: 'hour' | 'day' | 'month'): CostSummary;
  getBudgetAlerts(): BudgetAlert[];
  forecastCosts(days: number): CostForecast;
}
```

### **Enhancement 3: Dynamic Model Health Monitoring**
**Goal**: Monitor Gemini model health and automatically handle failures.

**Features**:
- **Model Health Checks**: Continuous monitoring of model availability
- **Automatic Failover**: Seamless switching to backup models
- **Performance Degradation Detection**: Identify when models perform below expectations
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Intelligent retry with different models

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface ModelHealthMonitor {
  checkModelHealth(modelId: string): ModelHealthStatus;
  enableAutoFailover(enabled: boolean): void;
  getHealthMetrics(): ModelHealthMetrics[];
  detectPerformanceDegradation(): PerformanceAlert[];
}
```

### **Enhancement 4: Advanced Task Classification**
**Goal**: More intelligent task classification for optimal model selection.

**Features**:
- **Task Complexity Analysis**: Analyze task complexity to choose appropriate tier
- **Multi-Modal Detection**: Automatically detect when multimodal capabilities needed
- **Context-Aware Selection**: Consider conversation history for model selection
- **Workload Balancing**: Distribute load across models for optimal performance

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface AdvancedTaskClassifier {
  analyzeTaskComplexity(task: string, context?: string[]): TaskComplexity;
  detectModalityRequirements(input: string): ModalityRequirements;
  recommendOptimalModel(analysis: TaskAnalysis): ModelRecommendation;
  balanceWorkload(availableModels: string[]): LoadBalancingStrategy;
}
```

### **Enhancement 5: Enterprise Integration Features**
**Goal**: Add enterprise-grade features for production deployment.

**Features**:
- **Role-Based Model Access**: Control which teams can use premium models
- **Compliance Logging**: Detailed audit logs for regulatory compliance
- **Custom Model Integration**: Support for custom fine-tuned models
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Different configurations for dev/staging/prod

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface EnterpriseIntegration {
  enforceRoleBasedAccess(userId: string, requestedTier: string): boolean;
  logComplianceEvent(event: ComplianceEvent): void;
  registerCustomModel(model: CustomModelSpec): void;
  getEnvironmentConfig(env: 'dev' | 'staging' | 'prod'): TierConfig;
}
```
