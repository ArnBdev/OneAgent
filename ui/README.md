# OneAgent UI (Future Implementation)

> **Status:** Planning Phase - Implementation Deferred  
> **Priority:** After core MCP and agent foundation completion

## OneAgent Vision: One Agent for All Life Domains

OneAgent is designed as a **comprehensive life assistant** covering all domains:

- 💼 **Work & Professional:** Coding, project management, business tasks
- 🏠 **Personal Life:** Health, fitness, finances, relationships
- 🎯 **Goals & Growth:** Learning, habits, personal development
- 🛠️ **Technical:** Development workflows, automation, system management

### Multi-Platform Architecture

```
OneAgent Core (MCP Server)
├── 🖥️ Desktop UI (Web-based, future)
├── 📱 Mobile Apps (iOS/Android, future commercial)
├── 💻 VS Code Integration (GitHub Copilot MCP Server)
├── 🌐 Web Dashboard (Cross-platform access)
└── 🔌 API Endpoints (Third-party integrations)
```

### VS Code Integration (Primary Use Case)

OneAgent serves as an **MCP server for GitHub Copilot**, providing:

- **Constitutional AI** guidance for code quality
- **BMAD Framework** analysis for architectural decisions
- **Memory-driven** development patterns and best practices
- **Multi-agent** collaboration for complex coding tasks
- **Context7** integration for real-time documentation

## Current Status

The UI implementation is **intentionally deferred** to focus on building a solid foundation:

1. **Core OneAgent MCP Server** (In Progress)
2. **Agent Communication System** (In Progress)
3. **Memory & Intelligence Systems** (In Progress)
4. **API Stability & Testing** (In Progress)

## Future UI Architecture

### Recommended Approach: Custom Implementation

After evaluating existing agent UI projects, a **custom implementation** is recommended for OneAgent's specific needs:

#### Why Not Existing Solutions?

**AG-UI Protocol** (`ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui`):

- ✅ **Strengths:** Solid protocol design, event-based architecture, broad framework support
- ❌ **Limitations:** Designed for generic agent-app integration, not specialized for MCP-native agents like OneAgent
- ❌ **Complexity:** Adds unnecessary protocol layer when OneAgent already uses MCP as primary interface
- ❌ **Dependencies:** Would require OneAgent to emit AG-UI events alongside MCP messages
- ❌ **VS Code Integration:** Doesn't align with OneAgent's role as MCP server for GitHub Copilot

**Agno Agent UI** (`agno-agi/agent-ui`):

- ✅ **Strengths:** Clean Next.js implementation, good visual design
- ❌ **Limitations:** Tightly coupled to Agno framework (connects to `localhost:7777`)
- ❌ **Architecture:** Simple chat interface, doesn't leverage OneAgent's comprehensive life domain capabilities
- ❌ **Missing Features:** No MCP integration, no Constitutional AI visualization, no BMAD framework support
- ❌ **Scope:** Chat-focused, not designed for multi-domain life management or VS Code integration

### OneAgent UI Requirements

## Why This MCP-First Approach?

1. **VS Code Integration First:** Primary use case as GitHub Copilot MCP server
2. **Life Domain Unity:** Single agent managing work, personal, health, learning domains
3. **MCP-Native:** Built specifically for OneAgent's MCP architecture, no protocol translation
4. **Constitutional AI Integration:** Built-in code quality and decision-making guidance
5. **Future Commercial Potential:** Scalable architecture for mobile apps and enterprise
6. **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Unified experience across desktop, mobile, and VS Code
7. **Privacy-First:** Personal data stays local, work data properly isolated
8. **Maintainable:** Custom code under full control, evolves with OneAgent capabilities

### MCP-First vs Traditional Approaches

**Traditional Agent UIs:**

- Chat-focused interfaces
- Custom API integration required
- Limited to specific use cases
- Separate tools for different domains

**OneAgent MCP-First UI:**

- Life domain-focused dashboard
- Native MCP protocol integration
- VS Code Copilot enhancement as primary use case
- Unified interface for all life aspects
- Constitutional AI quality guidance built-in
- Future commercial and mobile expansion ready

---

**Current Priority:** Complete MCP foundation and VS Code integration, then expand to standalone UI for comprehensive life domain management with future commercial potential.
