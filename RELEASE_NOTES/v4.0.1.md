# OneAgent v4.0.1 – Final Mainline Release

Date: 2025-08-16

This release finalizes the mainline v4.0.x series. It consolidates runtime readiness, stream validation, and release hygiene to professional standards.

## Highlights
- Runtime smoke harness now validates:
  - Memory server readiness via `/health` with JSON validation
  - MCP server health and info
  - JSON-RPC `initialize` and `tools/list`
  - SSE heartbeat on `GET /mcp` (content-type + heartbeat/event observed)
  - Optional authenticated memory `GET /v1/memories/stats` (when `MEM0_API_KEY` present)
- Startup script improved with `.env` guidance and readiness probes
- CI workflow runs type-check, lint, and runtime smoke on push/PR

## Breaking Changes
None.

## Upgrade Notes
1. Ensure `.env` includes valid `MEM0_API_KEY` if you want the optional stats check to pass.
2. Use `scripts/start-oneagent-system.ps1` to start both servers; it waits for readiness.
3. Use `npm run verify:runtime` locally for a quick health validation.

## How We Verified
- Repeated runtime smoke runs with `.env` loaded (Node 22, Python 3.11)
- SSE stream validated via heartbeat and event reception
- CI workflow added to catch regressions automatically
