# OneAgent v4.0.2

Date: 2025-08-16

## Highlights
- A2A protocol default set to 0.2.6 for forward-compat.
- Dual well-known endpoints exposed by MCP server:
  - /.well-known/agent-card.json (preferred for >=0.3.0)
  - /.well-known/agent.json (legacy for 0.2.x)
- Docs updated to list endpoints and outline 0.3.0 interop plan.
- Added hello demo: `npm run demo:hello`.

## Stability
- No breaking changes; minimal, low-risk improvements.
- Verified type-check, lint, and runtime smoke locally.

## Next
- If targeting public interop: implement extended card, signatures, mTLS/OAuth2 metadata, and multi-transport announcements in a future track.
