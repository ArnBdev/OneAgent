# OneAgent Development Roadmap 2025

## 🎯 **Vision & Core Concept**

OneAgent is an AI agent platform designed to serve humans through contextual assistance while maintaining complete data privacy and operating without cloud dependencies. The agent learns over time through local semantic memory and supports various roles (advisor, assistant, coach, etc.).

---

## 🧱 **Architecture Overview (BMAD Model)**

OneAgent is built on the **BMAD architecture**, separating agent capabilities into four distinct domains:

- **🧠 Behavior**: Decision-making, personality, and behavioral patterns
- **💾 Memory**: Contextual memory storage, retrieval, and semantic search
- **⚡ Action**: Tool integration, API usage, and external service interaction
- **💬 Dialogue**: Language interaction, UI communication, and conversation management
