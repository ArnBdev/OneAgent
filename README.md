## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### Quick Start (Local MCP + Memory)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and optionally set:
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required for real memory operations)
   - `MEM0_API_KEY` (enables authenticated memory stats/read and is required for writes)
2. Start both servers with readiness checks:
   - Windows PowerShell: `./scripts/start-oneagent-system.ps1`
3. Validate runtime (type-check, lint, smoke including SSE and memory health):
   - `npm run verify:runtime`

Default endpoints:

- Memory server: http://127.0.0.1:8010 (GET /health)
- MCP server: http://127.0.0.1:8083 (GET /health, GET /mcp for SSE)
- A2A well-known Agent Card (served by MCP server):
  - Preferred (A2A >= 0.3.0): http://127.0.0.1:8083/.well-known/agent-card.json
  - Legacy alias (A2A 0.2.x): http://127.0.0.1:8083/.well-known/agent.json
  - Notes: Default A2A protocol advertised is 0.2.6; extended card is not required for 0.2.x.

### Try it in 2 minutes (Hello A2A)

With servers running:

```bash
npm run demo:hello
```

This validates MCP /health, /info, JSON-RPC initialize, tools/list, and confirms SSE heartbeat‚Äîwithout writing to memory.

### Developer commands

```bash
# Install deps
npm install

# Type + lint quick verify
npm run verify

# Start MCP only
npm run server:unified

# Runtime smoke (starts memory + MCP if needed, probes SSE)
npm run verify:runtime

# A2A tests (fast mode, runner ensures memory is up)
npm run test:a2a
```

### Model Picker (Unified)

- Use `coreagent/config/UnifiedModelPicker.ts` to select models by role:
  - demanding_llm ‚Üí gemini-2.5-pro
  - fast_llm ‚Üí gemini-2.5-flash
  - ultrafast_llm ‚Üí gemini-2.5-flash-lite
  - embedding ‚Üí gemini-embedding-001
- Provider explicit picks supported (OpenAI GPT‚Äë5 family). Env model-name variables are deprecated; keep env for API keys only.
- See docs/models/README.md for examples.

## üß™ Testing (Dual-Mode Communication & Monitoring Verification)

The communication subsystem is validated in two modes to ensure zero regression while keeping CI fast:

1. Monitoring Disabled Mode (fast, silent):
   - Env: `ONEAGENT_FAST_TEST_MODE=1`, `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_AUTO_MONITORING=1`, `ONEAGENT_SILENCE_COMM_LOGS=1`
   - Purpose: Validate core communication flow & legacy pattern absence without incurring monitoring overhead.
   - Operation event assertions are intentionally skipped (monitoring stub returns no events).

2. Monitoring Enabled Mode (coverage enforcement):
   - Env: `ONEAGENT_FAST_TEST_MODE=1`, `ONEAGENT_SILENCE_COMM_LOGS=1` (monitoring flag unset)
   - Purpose: Enforce presence of `operation` field events for all canonical methods:
     `registerAgent`, `discoverAgents`, `createSession`, `sendMessage`, `getMessageHistory`.
   - Fails build if any required operation event is missing.

The `scripts/verify-build.js` script orchestrates both passes and performs an in-process post-run verification to guarantee operation coverage (no reliance on only the test process memory). A lightweight utility `tests/utils/monitoringTestUtils.ts` provides reusable coverage assertions (no parallel metrics state‚Äîderives strictly from monitoring events).

Run full verification locally:

```bash
node scripts/verify-build.js
```

Environment Flags Summary:

- `ONEAGENT_FAST_TEST_MODE=1` ‚Üí In-memory agent/session/message registries (zero external dependencies)
- `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_AUTO_MONITORING=1` ‚Üí Replaces monitoring singleton with no-op stub (skips event assertions)
- `ONEAGENT_SILENCE_COMM_LOGS=1` ‚Üí Suppresses verbose communication logs for cleaner CI output

Rate limit enforcement (30 msgs / 60s per agent-session) is covered by `tests/canonical/communication-rate-limit.test.ts` and executes in fast mode. Both conformance and rate limit tests exit cleanly to avoid lingering handles, ensuring CI stability.

This dual-mode strategy delivers deterministic coverage plus minimal runtime overhead, preserving canonical single-source monitoring (UnifiedMonitoringService) without introducing parallel systems.

## üîÆ **Roadmap (Canonical)**

The previous fragmented roadmap files have been superseded by a single canonical roadmap: **[docs/roadmap.md](./docs/roadmap.md)** (aligned with v4.0.7). It defines release train (v4.1‚Äìv6.0), thematic backlogs (Observability, NLACS, Planner, UI, Extensibility, Scale, Governance), KPIs, risks, and an Immediate Action Queue.

Key near-term (v4.1‚Äìv4.2):

- Error taxonomy enforcement in metrics & JSON endpoint
- SLO config + baseline alert pack (see `docs/monitoring/ALERTS.md`)
- Histogram implementation (foundation for accurate p95/p99 & burn rates)
- Resilience primitives (circuit breakers, retry policy hardening)

Subsequent (v4.3‚Äìv4.5): NLACS entity extraction, Planner strategic layer, Phase A Web UI (metrics, agents, memory explorer, SSE stream).

Longer horizon: Plugin SDK, clustering, anomaly detection, governance + policy engine, emergent insight ranking.

## üîß **Technical Specifications**

### **Requirements**

- **Node.js v22+**: Modern JavaScript runtime
- **TypeScript 5.7+**: Strict type safety
- **mem0**: Memory backend system
- **Constitutional AI**: Safety and ethical validation

### **Architecture**

- **70,000+ lines** of professional-grade TypeScript
- **Zero compilation errors** with strict type checking
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- **Full memory integration** with persistent learning

### **Canonical Memory API (Unified Metadata)**

All memory writes MUST use the canonical path:

```ts
// Preferred ergonomic alias (delegates to canonical)
await memory.addMemory(
  'User prefers dark mode',
  {
    category: 'preferences',
    tags: ['ui', 'theme'],
    importance: 'standard',
  },
  userId,
);

// Direct canonical form (same effect)
await memory.addMemoryCanonical(
  'User prefers dark mode',
  {
    category: 'preferences',
    tags: ['ui', 'theme'],
    importance: 'standard',
  },
  userId,
);
```

Unified metadata is internally normalized via the UnifiedMetadata service (system/content/temporal/custom blocks). The legacy object-form call:

```ts
// ‚ùå DEPRECATED & REMOVED
await memory.addMemory({ content: "...", metadata: { ... } });
```

has been fully removed. Batch operations and tools now automatically construct canonical metadata; no parallel memory write paths remain. This consolidation improves analytics fidelity, learning consistency, and future adapter simplification potential (e.g., `adaptSearchResponse`).

### Monitoring Control (Lightweight Scripts)

Set environment variable `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_AUTO_MONITORING=1` to prevent automatic monitoring service instantiation during simple imports (unit tests, one-off scripts). All periodic timers also use `unref()` so they won't block process exit when enabled.

### Canonical Agent Communication (Consolidated)

All agent-to-agent (A2A) coordination uses `UnifiedAgentCommunicationService` (singleton exported as `unifiedAgentCommunicationService`). Legacy service names (`AgentCommunicationService`, `A2ACommunicationService`, `MultiAgentCommunicationService`) are guarded by throwing stubs in `DeprecatedCommunication.ts` to prevent parallel system regression. A conformance test (`tests/canonical/communication-conformance.test.ts`) enforces:

- Successful register ‚Üí discover ‚Üí createSession ‚Üí sendMessage ‚Üí getMessageHistory flow
- Monitoring events with explicit `operation` field for each core method
- Absence of legacy class references in the codebase

Rate limiting (30 messages / 60s per agent-session) is enforced and covered by `communication-rate-limit.test.ts`.

Monitoring events now include an explicit `operation` field (in addition to the descriptive message) for robust assertion and aggregation, while `trackOperation` remains the canonical entry point (no parallel metrics store).

### Metrics & Error Taxonomy JSON Endpoint

- Prometheus exposition: `GET /api/v1/metrics/prometheus`
- Structured JSON (UI consumption): `GET /api/v1/metrics/json` returns `{ stats, operations, errors[] }` where `errors[].errorCode` is taxonomy-mapped.
- Error codes sanitized & derived through `getErrorCodeLabel()` ensuring low cardinality.

### Public interop (A2A 0.3.0 readiness plan)

- Status: Forward-compatible. We serve both `/.well-known/agent-card.json` (preferred) and `/.well-known/agent.json` (legacy) and advertise protocol 0.2.6 by default.
- Planned for public interop (future major): - Extended Agent Card handler (authenticated optional) - AgentCard signatures (trust attestation) - mTLS and OAuth2 metadata in `securitySchemes` - Multiple transport announcement (Transport enum), push notification configs - Documentation updates and conformance tests
  These are intentionally deferred to keep v4.0.1 stable; implement when external A2A registry/agents integration is prioritized.
