## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### Quick Start (Local MCP + Memory)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and optionally set:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required for real memory operations)
- `MEM0_API_KEY` (enables authenticated memory stats/read and is required for writes)

2. Start both servers with readiness checks:

- Windows PowerShell: `./scripts/start-oneagent-system.ps1`

3. Validate runtime (type-check, lint, smoke including HTTP stream and memory health):

- `npm run verify:runtime`

Embedding provider selection (envs):

- `ONEAGENT_EMBEDDINGS_SOURCE=openai|gemini|node` (default `node`)
- If `openai`: set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, optionally `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` (default `text-embedding-3-small`) and for the Python memory server `OPENAI_EMBED_DIM` (default `1536`).
- Cooldown control: `ONEAGENT_EMBEDDINGS_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=5` (reduces log spam when gateway is down).
- LLM preference toggles: `ONEAGENT_PREFER_OPENAI=1`, `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_GEMINI=1`.

Startup tip: Start MCP before the memory server (or ensure MCP is ready) to avoid temporary memory-server gateway warnings while it tries to reach `/api/v1/embeddings`.

#### VS Code + Copilot Integration

- See [docs/IDE_SETUP.md](./docs/IDE_SETUP.md) for wiring Copilot Chat to the unified MCP server and recommended extensions.
- Copilot Chat expects command-based MCP (see `.vscode/mcp.json`). The HTTP endpoint (`http://localhost:8083/mcp`) is for tooling/debug only.
- Stdio mode now hard-blocks any non-framed stdout writes: only JSON-RPC frames go to stdout; all other logs are routed to stderr (or an optional file). Set `ONEAGENT_STDIO_MODE=1` (default).
- Optional diagnostics for stdio: set `ONEAGENT_STDIO_LOG_TO_FILE=1` and (optionally) `ONEAGENT_STDIO_LOG_FILE=./logs/mcp-server/stdio.log` to capture suppressed stdout text.
- Ports/URLs are env-driven. Set `ONEAGENT_HOST` and the `ONEAGENT_*_PORT` values (or explicit `*_URL`s) to avoid conflicts.

#### Create a BMAD Story (DX improvement)

- From VS Code: Run the "Create Story (BMAD template)" task and enter a title.
- Or via npm: `npm run story:new -- "Your Story Title"`

Default endpoints:

- Memory server: http://127.0.0.1:8010 (GET /health, GET /readyz for readiness)
- MCP server: http://127.0.0.1:8083 (GET /health, POST /mcp for JSON-RPC, POST /mcp/stream for NDJSON)
- A2A well-known Agent Card (served by MCP server):
  - Preferred (A2A >= 0.3.0): http://127.0.0.1:8083/.well-known/agent-card.json
  - Legacy alias (A2A 0.2.x): http://127.0.0.1:8083/.well-known/agent.json
  - Notes: Default A2A protocol advertised is 0.2.6; extended card is not required for 0.2.x.

### Try it in 2 minutes (Hello A2A)

With servers running:

```bash
npm run demo:hello
```

This validates MCP /health, /info, JSON-RPC initialize, tools/list, and confirms NDJSON streaming via /mcp/stream—without writing to memory.

### Tool Sets control (limit exposed tools)

To keep the active tool list small, use tool-set toggling via MCP methods:

- List sets:

```json
{ "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "tools/sets" }
```

- Activate sets (applies engine-level filtering to tools/list and execution):

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/sets/activate",
  "params": { "setIds": ["system-management", "research-analysis"] }
}
```

Notes:

- The server adds `X-OneAgent-Tool-Count` header on /mcp responses to observe the filtered count.
- Some tools are always allowed (e.g., `oneagent_system_health`), and A2A-prefixed tools remain available.
- You can also toggle inside the engine via tool `oneagent_toolsets_toggle` with the same `setIds` shape.

### Developer commands

```bash
# Install deps
npm install

# Type + lint quick verify (TypeScript 5.9, ESLint 9)
npm run verify

# Start MCP only
npm run server:unified

# Runtime smoke (starts memory + MCP if needed, probes stream). UI uses Vite 7.
npm run verify:runtime

# A2A tests (fast mode, runner ensures memory is up)
npm run test:a2a
```

### Model Picker (Unified)

- Use `coreagent/config/UnifiedModelPicker.ts` to select models by role:
  - demanding_llm → gemini-2.5-pro
  - fast_llm → gemini-2.5-flash
  - ultrafast_llm → gemini-2.5-flash-lite
  - embedding → gemini-embedding-001
- Provider explicit picks supported (OpenAI GPT‑5 family). Env model-name variables are deprecated; keep env for API keys only.
- See docs/models/README.md for examples.

## 🧪 Testing (Dual-Mode Communication, Mission Control & Monitoring Verification)

The communication subsystem is validated in two modes to ensure zero regression while keeping CI fast:

1. Monitoring Disabled Mode (fast, silent):
   - Env: `ONEAGENT_FAST_TEST_MODE=1`, `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_AUTO_MONITORING=1`, `ONEAGENT_SILENCE_COMM_LOGS=1`
   - Purpose: Validate core communication flow & legacy pattern absence without incurring monitoring overhead.
   - Operation event assertions are intentionally skipped (monitoring stub returns no events).

2. Monitoring Enabled Mode (coverage enforcement):
   - Env: `ONEAGENT_FAST_TEST_MODE=1`, `ONEAGENT_SILENCE_COMM_LOGS=1` (monitoring flag unset)
   - Purpose: Enforce presence of `operation` field events for all canonical methods:
     `registerAgent`, `discoverAgents`, `createSession`, `sendMessage`, `getMessageHistory`.
   - Fails build if any required operation event is missing.

The `scripts/verify-build.js` script orchestrates both passes and performs an in-process post-run verification to guarantee operation coverage (no reliance on only the test process memory). A lightweight utility `tests/utils/monitoringTestUtils.ts` provides reusable coverage assertions (no parallel metrics state—derives strictly from monitoring events).

Run full verification locally:

```bash
node scripts/verify-build.js
```

Environment Flags Summary:

- `ONEAGENT_FAST_TEST_MODE=1` → In-memory agent/session/message registries (zero external dependencies)
- `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_AUTO_MONITORING=1` → Replaces monitoring singleton with no-op stub (skips event assertions)
- `ONEAGENT_SILENCE_COMM_LOGS=1` → Suppresses verbose communication logs for cleaner CI output

Rate limit enforcement (30 msgs / 60s per agent-session) is covered by `tests/canonical/communication-rate-limit.test.ts` and executes in fast mode. Both conformance and rate limit tests exit cleanly to avoid lingering handles, ensuring CI stability.

This dual-mode strategy delivers deterministic coverage plus minimal runtime overhead, preserving canonical single-source monitoring (UnifiedMonitoringService) without introducing parallel systems.

### Mission Control Test Coverage (v4.2.0)

- JSON Schema validation for all outbound mission control frames (including new `mission_stats` variant)
- Lifecycle sequencing: planning_started → tasks_generated → planned → execution_started → execution_progress → (completed|cancelled|error)
- Cancellation path: `mission_cancel` inbound frame triggers engine termination, registry updates, and terminal status emission
- Code generation drift guard: `npm run codegen:mission-control:check` fails if generated types not in sync with schemas
- Generated type coverage test ensures new statuses & `mission_stats` presence

### Mission Control Quick Start

Subscribe to channels after opening a WebSocket to `/ws/mission-control`:

```json
{ "type": "subscribe", "channels": ["mission_update", "mission_stats"] }
```

Start a mission (send as normal client message):

```json
{ "type": "mission_start", "command": "/mission { \n  \"objective\": \"Generate project initialization plan\"\n}" }
```

Receive lifecycle frames (example abbreviated):

```json
{ "type": "mission_update", "payload": { "missionId": "...", "status": "planning_started" }}
{ "type": "mission_update", "payload": { "missionId": "...", "status": "tasks_generated", "tasksSummary": ["Task A", "Task B"] }}
{ "type": "mission_update", "payload": { "missionId": "...", "status": "planned" }}
{ "type": "mission_update", "payload": { "missionId": "...", "status": "execution_started" }}
{ "type": "mission_update", "payload": { "missionId": "...", "status": "execution_progress", "progress": { "index": 1, "total": 4 } }}
{ "type": "mission_update", "payload": { "missionId": "...", "status": "completed" }}
```

Cancel a mission:

```json
{ "type": "mission_cancel", "missionId": "<id>" }
```

Stats snapshot (emitted immediately + interval):

```json
{ "type": "mission_stats", "payload": { "active": 1, "completed": 3, "cancelled": 0, "errors": 0, "avgDurationMs": 542, "snapshotId": "op_..." }}
```

TypeScript guard usage (generated):

```ts
import { isMissionUpdate, isMissionStats } from './coreagent/server/mission-control/generated/mission-control-message-types';

function handle(msg: unknown) {
  if (isMissionUpdate(msg)) {
    // Narrowed to mission_update variant
    console.log(msg.payload.status);
  } else if (isMissionStats(msg)) {
    console.log('Active missions', msg.payload.active);
  }
}
```

```

### Planned Metrics Export (v4.2.x)

Upcoming Prometheus derivations (no parallel store):

| Gauge / Counter | Description | Source |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------ |
| `oneagent_mission_active` | Current active missions | Mission registry snapshot |
| `oneagent_mission_completed_total` | Total completed missions since process start | Registry terminal counts |
| `oneagent_mission_cancelled_total` | Total cancelled missions | Registry terminal counts |
| `oneagent_mission_error_total` | Total errored missions | Registry terminal counts |
| `oneagent_mission_avg_duration_ms` | Rolling average completion duration | Computed per snapshot |

All will be derived on scrape from the registry to maintain single-source state.

### Memory-backed tests and readiness

- The canonical memory client exposes readiness helpers:
  - `await OneAgentMemory.getInstance().ready()` → probes `/readyz`
  - `await OneAgentMemory.getInstance().waitForReady(20000, 750)` → polls until ready or timeout
- Persistence-oriented tests should call `waitForReady(...)` and skip gracefully if not ready (useful in CI where the memory backend may be disabled).
- The NLACS persistence test adopts this pattern to avoid flakes while keeping coverage meaningful when memory is available.

See also: `tests/README.md` → “Persistence tests with readiness” for a quickstart and the local script to run NLACS persistence tests.

### A2A invariants and conformance

- Conformance: `npm run test:a2a-conformance`
- Invariants (send/receive counts, broadcast fan-out, handler lifecycle): `npm run test:a2a-invariants`

## 📈 **Revolutionary Capabilities**

### **1. Proactive Intelligence**

Transform from reactive responses to proactive suggestions based on learned patterns and successful outcomes.

Includes a bounded task delegation queue with:

- Signature-based dedup (`snapshotHash::action`) preventing flooding.
- Canonical memory audit writes for each enqueue & state transition (no secondary persistence system).
- Restart resilience (stage 1): queue reconstruction via `restore` operation from prior `ProactiveDelegation:*` memory entries plus lightweight opportunistic snapshots (`TaskDelegationSnapshot`).
- Configurable retry policy: `ONEAGENT_TASK_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 3) controls bounded exponential-style retry attempts (queue re-entry emits `retry`, exhaustion emits `retry_exhausted`).

### **2. Cross-Conversation Learning**

- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify successful workflows across multiple sessions
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Apply insights from one conversation to improve future interactions
- **Institutional Memory**: Build and evolve organizational knowledge over time

### **3. Emergent Intelligence Synthesis**

- **Breakthrough Detection**: Automatically identify revolutionary insights
- **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Combine insights from different domains
- **Intelligence Amplification**: Enhance human and agent intelligence systematically

### **4. Memory-Driven Optimization**

- **Workflow Optimization**: Suggest improvements based on historical success
- **Predictive Intelligence**: Predict likely outcomes and optimal strategies
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimize resources through historical performance data

## 🔮 **Roadmap (Canonical)**

The previous fragmented roadmap files have been superseded by a single canonical roadmap: **[docs/ROADMAP.md](./docs/ROADMAP.md)** (aligned with v4.1.0). It defines release train (v4.1–v6.0), thematic backlogs (Observability, NLACS, Planner, UI, Extensibility, Scale, Governance), KPIs, risks, and an Immediate Action Queue.

Key near-term (v4.2+):

- Mission Control: anomaly_alert channel & authentication options
- Error taxonomy enforcement in metrics & JSON endpoint (enhanced status labeling)
- SLO config + baseline alert pack (see `docs/monitoring/ALERTS.md`)
- Histogram implementation (foundation for accurate p95/p99 & burn rates)
- Resilience primitives (circuit breakers, retry policy hardening)

Subsequent (v4.3–v4.5): NLACS entity extraction, Planner strategic layer, Phase A Web UI (metrics, agents, memory explorer, SSE stream).

Longer horizon: Plugin SDK, clustering, anomaly detection, governance + policy engine, emergent insight ranking.

- **Self-improving system** that evolves through experience
- **Proactive intelligence** that prevents problems before they occur

## 🔧 **Technical Specifications**

### **Requirements**

- Node.js v22+
- TypeScript 5.9+
- Vite 7 (UI tooling)
- mem0 (memory backend)
- Constitutional AI (safety and ethical validation)

### **Architecture**

- **70,000+ lines** of professional-grade TypeScript
- **Zero compilation errors** with strict type checking
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- **Full memory integration** with persistent learning

### **Canonical Memory API (Unified Metadata)**

All memory writes MUST use the canonical path:

```ts
// Preferred ergonomic alias (delegates to canonical)
await memory.addMemory(
  'User prefers dark mode',
  {
    category: 'preferences',
    tags: ['ui', 'theme'],
    importance: 'standard',
  },
  userId,
);

// Direct canonical form (same effect)
await memory.addMemoryCanonical(
  'User prefers dark mode',
  {
    category: 'preferences',
    tags: ['ui', 'theme'],
    importance: 'standard',
  },
  userId,
);
```

Unified metadata is internally normalized via the UnifiedMetadata service (system/content/temporal/custom blocks). The legacy object-form call:

```ts
// ❌ DEPRECATED & REMOVED
await memory.addMemory({ content: "...", metadata: { ... } });
```

has been fully removed. Batch operations and tools now automatically construct canonical metadata; no parallel memory write paths remain. This consolidation improves analytics fidelity, learning consistency, and future adapter simplification potential (e.g., `adaptSearchResponse`).

### Monitoring Control (Lightweight Scripts)

Set environment variable `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_AUTO_MONITORING=1` to prevent automatic monitoring service instantiation during simple imports (unit tests, one-off scripts). All periodic timers also use `unref()` so they won't block process exit when enabled.

### Canonical Agent Communication (Consolidated)

All agent-to-agent (A2A) coordination uses `UnifiedAgentCommunicationService` (singleton exported as `unifiedAgentCommunicationService`). Legacy service names (`AgentCommunicationService`, `A2ACommunicationService`, `MultiAgentCommunicationService`) are guarded by throwing stubs in `DeprecatedCommunication.ts` to prevent parallel system regression. A conformance test (`tests/canonical/communication-conformance.test.ts`) enforces:

- Successful register → discover → createSession → sendMessage → getMessageHistory flow
- Monitoring events with explicit `operation` field for each core method
- Absence of legacy class references in the codebase

Rate limiting (30 messages / 60s per agent-session) is enforced and covered by `communication-rate-limit.test.ts`.

Monitoring events now include an explicit `operation` field (in addition to the descriptive message) for robust assertion and aggregation, while `trackOperation` remains the canonical entry point (no parallel metrics store).

### Orchestration (Production)

- HybridAgentOrchestrator handles agent discovery/selection, task assignment, workflow sessions, and dependency-aware execution using canonical communication and memory audit trails.
- ProactiveTriageOrchestrator runs periodic triage + deep analysis, integrates with task delegation, and emits monitoring events; optional memory persistence for proactive insights.
- See `docs/ORCHESTRATION_OVERVIEW.md` for architecture, maturity, and next steps.

### Metrics & Error Taxonomy JSON Endpoint

- Prometheus exposition: `GET /api/v1/metrics/prometheus`
- Structured JSON (UI consumption): `GET /api/v1/metrics/json` returns `{ stats, operations, errors[] }` where `errors[].errorCode` is taxonomy-mapped.
- Error codes sanitized & derived through `getErrorCodeLabel()` ensuring low cardinality.

### Public interop (A2A 0.3.0 readiness plan)

- Status: Forward-compatible. We serve both `/.well-known/agent-card.json` (preferred) and `/.well-known/agent.json` (legacy) and advertise protocol 0.2.6 by default.
- Planned for public interop (future major): - Extended Agent Card handler (authenticated optional) - AgentCard signatures (trust attestation) - mTLS and OAuth2 metadata in `securitySchemes` - Multiple transport announcement (Transport enum), push notification configs - Documentation updates and conformance tests
  These are intentionally deferred to keep v4.0.1 stable; implement when external A2A registry/agents integration is prioritized.
