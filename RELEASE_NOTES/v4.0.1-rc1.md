# OneAgent v4.0.1-rc1 - Release Notes

Date: 2025-08-16

Summary

- Release candidate consolidating runtime stability and startup readiness improvements.

Key changes

- Runtime smoke harness (`scripts/runtime-smoke.ts`)
  - Loads `.env` from repo root so runtime checks use the same `MEM0_API_KEY` and ports as the servers.
  - Adds an SSE probe against `/mcp` to verify event-stream connectivity and heartbeat.
  - Adds an optional authenticated memory stats check (`/v1/memories/stats`) when `MEM0_API_KEY` is present.
- Startup script (`scripts/start-oneagent-system.ps1`)
  - Startup banner documents `.env` usage and the importance of `MEM0_API_KEY`.
  - Readiness probe now uses the memory `/health` endpoint.
  - Prints whether `MEM0_API_KEY` is set for quick debugging.

Notes

- The authenticated memory stats check remains optional to avoid flakiness when the memory server is already running with a different key.
- Tag `v4.0.1-rc1` created and branch `release/v4.0.1-rc1` pushed for review.

How to test

1. Ensure `.env` contains `MEM0_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
2. Start the system via `./scripts/start-oneagent-system.ps1`.
3. Run `npm run smoke:runtime` â€” the harness should pass including the authenticated stats check.
