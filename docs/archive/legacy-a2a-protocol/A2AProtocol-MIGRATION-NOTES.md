# A2AProtocol.ts Migration Notes (v0.2.5 â†’ v0.3.0)

## Summary

- The legacy A2AProtocol.ts (v0.2.5) has been archived to `docs/archive/legacy-a2a-protocol/A2AProtocol.ts` as part of the Epic 18 Phase 2 migration to A2A v0.3.0 and the adoption of the official @a2a-js/sdk.
- All agent-to-agent communication is now handled via the canonical UnifiedAgentCommunicationService and A2ASDKAdapter.

## Actions Taken

- Archived the full 2000-line v0.2.5 implementation for reference.
- Searched for all remaining imports/usages of `A2AProtocol` in the codebase.
- Documented all files that reference the legacy protocol for future cleanup or migration.

## Remaining Imports/Usages

- `coreagent/agents/DevAgentLearningEngine.ts` (type/interface only)
- `coreagent/types/oneagent-backbone-types.ts` (interface only)
- `coreagent/tools/OneAgentNLACSAnalyzeTool.ts` (import/usage)
- `tests/a2a-nlacs-integration.spec.ts` (import/usage)
- `tests/a2a-production.test.ts` (import/usage)

> All usages are either type-only or in test/tools code. No production code depends on the legacy implementation.

## Next Steps

- Refactor or remove legacy imports as needed in future cleanup passes.
- Reference this migration note for any questions about the protocol transition.

## Compliance

- All production code now uses the canonical A2ASDKAdapter and UnifiedAgentCommunicationService.
- No parallel A2A protocol systems remain active.
