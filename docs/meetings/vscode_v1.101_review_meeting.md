## Agent System Self-Diagnosis (Added June 12, 2025)

### Current System State
- Memory Server: **Running** (unified production version on port 8000)
- MCP Server: **Running** (port 8083)
- Agent Network Health: **92.57% Quality Score**
- Registered Agents: **7 agents** showing in health metrics

### Identified Issues
1. **Agent Visibility Issue**: `query_agent_capabilities` tool showing 0 agents despite 7 being registered
2. **Agent Persistence**: Auto-initialization script doesn't persist agent registrations between server restarts
3. **Mock/Real Memory System Conflict**: System previously using mock memory fallback instead of real persistent memory

### Root Cause Analysis
The team conducted a thorough analysis of the agent registration and discovery subsystems:

#### Memory System Issues
TriageAgent reports: "The memory system detection shows an anomaly. While the real memory server is running, the MCP server's memory client may still be configured to use the mock fallback system, leading to registration data being stored but not properly persisted or indexed for querying."

#### Coordination Protocol Issues
EnhancedDevAgent reports: "The core issue appears to be in the agent discovery protocol. While agents are registering correctly (as shown in the network health metrics), the query system uses a separate discovery index which isn't being populated with the registered agents."

#### Git History Analysis
ResearchAgent reports: "Analysis of git history shows that this worked previously because the system was using an in-memory registration system that populated both the health metrics and the discovery index simultaneously. The migration to a persistent memory-based system broke this synchronization."

### Recommendations from Agent Team
1. **Fix Agent Discovery System**:
   - Implement synchronization between agent registration and discovery index
   - Verify memory system configuration in the MCP server
   - Add validation step to ensure agents appear in both systems

2. **Persistence Enhancement**:
   - Improve agent persistence by storing registration data in the real memory system
   - Create system health monitor to verify registration/discovery synchronization

3. **Documentation Update**:
   - Document the fix in system architecture documentation
   - Update troubleshooting guide with detection and resolution steps
