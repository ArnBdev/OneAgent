# OneAgent Memory Server - Production Dependencies
# Updated: October 1, 2025
# Python: 3.13.3
# Target: OneAgent v4.3.0

# === Core Framework ===
fastmcp==2.12.4  # MCP server framework (official SDK foundation)

# === Memory & LLM ===
mem0ai==0.1.118  # Memory layer with graph backend (+26% accuracy vs OpenAI)
google-genai>=1.39.1  # Gemini unified SDK (required by mem0 0.1.118 for Gemini Flash LLM)

# === Memgraph Integration ===
# NOTE: langchain-memgraph required by mem0's Memgraph provider but causes heavyweight initialization
# overhead (PyTorch, transformers, etc.). Temporarily using in-memory graph store.
# langchain-memgraph>=0.1.9  # Memgraph integration (commented out - use in-memory for faster startup)

# === Vector & Storage ===
chromadb>=1.1.0  # Vector database for embeddings (latest stable with improved performance)
neo4j>=6.0.1  # Memgraph compatibility (Bolt protocol, latest stable)

# === HTTP & API ===
requests>=2.31.0  # HTTP client for OneAgent embeddings endpoint
python-multipart>=0.0.20  # File upload support (latest stable)

# === Configuration ===
python-dotenv>=1.1.1  # Environment variable management (Python 3.13 bugfixes)

# === Utilities ===
numpy>=2.3.3  # Numerical operations for embeddings (latest stable)

# === Optional (for future local embeddings fallback) ===
# sentence-transformers>=2.2.0  # Commented out - using OneAgent embeddings endpoint instead
