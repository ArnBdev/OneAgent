## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### Quick Start (Local MCP + Memory)

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and optionally set:
	- `GEMINI_API_KEY` (required for real memory operations)
	- `MEM0_API_KEY` (enables authenticated memory stats/read and is required for writes)
2. Start both servers with readiness checks:
	- Windows PowerShell: `scripts/start-oneagent-system.ps1`
3. Validate runtime (type-check, lint, smoke including SSE and memory health):
	- `npm run verify:runtime`

Default endpoints:
- Memory server: http://127.0.0.1:8010 (GET /health)
- MCP server: http://127.0.0.1:8083 (GET /health, GET /mcp for SSE)

### Try it in 2 minutes (Hello A2A)

With servers running:

```bash
npm run demo:hello
```

This validates MCP /health, /info, JSON-RPC initialize, tools/list, and confirms SSE heartbeat‚Äîwithout writing to memory.

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the system
npm run build

# Run Phase 4 functionality test
node test-phase4-simple.cjs

# Start MCP server for VS Code
npm run server:unified

# Development mode
npm run dev
```

## üß™ Testing (Dual-Mode Communication & Monitoring Verification)

The communication subsystem is validated in two modes to ensure zero regression while keeping CI fast:

1. Monitoring Disabled Mode (fast, silent):
	- Env: `ONEAGENT_FAST_TEST_MODE=1`, `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_AUTO_MONITORING=1`, `ONEAGENT_SILENCE_COMM_LOGS=1`
	- Purpose: Validate core communication flow & legacy pattern absence without incurring monitoring overhead.
	- Operation event assertions are intentionally skipped (monitoring stub returns no events).

2. Monitoring Enabled Mode (coverage enforcement):
	- Env: `ONEAGENT_FAST_TEST_MODE=1`, `ONEAGENT_SILENCE_COMM_LOGS=1` (monitoring flag unset)
	- Purpose: Enforce presence of `operation` field events for all canonical methods:
	  `registerAgent`, `discoverAgents`, `createSession`, `sendMessage`, `getMessageHistory`.
	- Fails build if any required operation event is missing.

The `scripts/verify-build.js` script orchestrates both passes and performs an in-process post-run verification to guarantee operation coverage (no reliance on only the test process memory). A lightweight utility `tests/utils/monitoringTestUtils.ts` provides reusable coverage assertions (no parallel metrics state‚Äîderives strictly from monitoring events).

Run full verification locally:
```bash
node scripts/verify-build.js
```

Environment Flags Summary:
- `ONEAGENT_FAST_TEST_MODE=1` ‚Üí In-memory agent/session/message registries (zero external dependencies)
- `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_AUTO_MONITORING=1` ‚Üí Replaces monitoring singleton with no-op stub (skips event assertions)
- `ONEAGENT_SILENCE_COMM_LOGS=1` ‚Üí Suppresses verbose communication logs for cleaner CI output

Rate limit enforcement (30 msgs / 60s per agent-session) is covered by `tests/canonical/communication-rate-limit.test.ts` and executes in fast mode. Both conformance and rate limit tests exit cleanly to avoid lingering handles, ensuring CI stability.

This dual-mode strategy delivers deterministic coverage plus minimal runtime overhead, preserving canonical single-source monitoring (UnifiedMonitoringService) without introducing parallel systems.
### **Phase 4 Testing**
```bash
# Verify all 8 Phase 4 core methods
node test-phase4-simple.cjs

# Expected output:
# ‚úÖ COMPLETE - All Phase 4 methods implemented
# ‚úÖ Memory-Driven Intelligence: Cross-conversation learning active
# ‚úÖ Emergent Intelligence: Breakthrough insight detection ready
# ‚úÖ Workflow Optimization: Historical pattern analysis functional
```

## üîß **Technical Specifications**

### **Requirements**
- **Node.js v22+**: Modern JavaScript runtime
- **TypeScript 5.7+**: Strict type safety
- **mem0**: Memory backend system
- **Constitutional AI**: Safety and ethical validation

### **Architecture**
- **70,000+ lines** of professional-grade TypeScript
- **Zero compilation errors** with strict type checking
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful fallbacks
- **Full memory integration** with persistent learning

### **Canonical Memory API (Unified Metadata)**
All memory writes MUST use the canonical path:

```ts
// Preferred ergonomic alias (delegates to canonical)
await memory.addMemory("User prefers dark mode", {
	category: "preferences",
	tags: ["ui", "theme"],
	importance: "standard"
}, userId);

// Direct canonical form (same effect)
await memory.addMemoryCanonical(
	"User prefers dark mode",
	{
		category: "preferences",
		tags: ["ui", "theme"],
		importance: "standard"
	},
	userId
);
```

Unified metadata is internally normalized via the UnifiedMetadata service (system/content/temporal/custom blocks). The legacy object-form call:

```ts
// ‚ùå DEPRECATED & REMOVED
await memory.addMemory({ content: "...", metadata: { ... } });
```

has been fully removed. Batch operations and tools now automatically construct canonical metadata; no parallel memory write paths remain. This consolidation improves analytics fidelity, learning consistency, and future adapter simplification potential (e.g., `adaptSearchResponse`).

### Monitoring Control (Lightweight Scripts)
Set environment variable `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_AUTO_MONITORING=1` to prevent automatic monitoring service instantiation during simple imports (unit tests, one-off scripts). All periodic timers also use `unref()` so they won't block process exit when enabled.

### Canonical Agent Communication (Consolidated)
All agent-to-agent (A2A) coordination uses `UnifiedAgentCommunicationService` (singleton exported as `unifiedAgentCommunicationService`). Legacy service names (`AgentCommunicationService`, `A2ACommunicationService`, `MultiAgentCommunicationService`) are guarded by throwing stubs in `DeprecatedCommunication.ts` to prevent parallel system regression. A conformance test (`tests/canonical/communication-conformance.test.ts`) enforces:
- Successful register ‚Üí discover ‚Üí createSession ‚Üí sendMessage ‚Üí getMessageHistory flow
- Monitoring events with explicit `operation` field for each core method
- Absence of legacy class references in the codebase

Rate limiting (30 messages / 60s per agent-session) is enforced and covered by `communication-rate-limit.test.ts`.

Monitoring events now include an explicit `operation` field (in addition to the descriptive message) for robust assertion and aggregation, while `trackOperation` remains the canonical entry point (no parallel metrics store).
