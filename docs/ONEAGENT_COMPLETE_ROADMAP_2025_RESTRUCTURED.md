## 🧠 BMAD Prompting Systems Analysis

*Research Date: June 9, 2025*

### Strategic Discovery Overview

Through comprehensive analysis of the BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-driven Development) methodology from the open-source repository `bmadcode/BMAD-METHOD`, we have identified sophisticated agent behavior guidance patterns that can significantly enhance OneAgent's prompting architecture and DevAgent implementation.

### Core BMAD Architecture Analysis

The BMAD framework demonstrates a mature **orchestrator-based multi-persona system** with:

- **🎭 Persona-Based Architecture**: Central orchestrator that embodies different specialist personas
- **⚙️ Configuration-Driven Behavior**: All agent definitions loaded from external config files
- **🔄 Dynamic Role Switching**: Seamless transformation between specialized roles
- **📋 Task-Execution Framework**: Standardized workflows with quality validation

### Key Behavioral Guidance Patterns

#### 1. Persona Definition Structure
```markdown
# Role: [Agent Type]

## Persona
- Role: [Specific title and function]
- Style: [Communication and interaction style] 
- Core Strength: [Primary capabilities and expertise]

## Core [Agent] Principles (Always Active)
[Fundamental operating principles that guide all behavior]

## Critical Start Up Operating Instructions
[Initial behavior when activated]
```

#### 2. Advanced Elicitation Framework (9-Point System)
0. **Expand or Contract for Audience** - Adaptive communication level
1. **Explain Reasoning (Chain of Thought)** - Step-by-step thinking process
2. **Critique and Refine** - Self-improvement mechanisms
3. **Analyze Logical Flow** - Dependency and consistency checking
