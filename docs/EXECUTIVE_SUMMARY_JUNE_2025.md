- Full JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation
- Session management with UUID tracking
- Security validation and error handling
- Production server running on port 8081

**✅ Complete MCP Protocol Support**
- `initialize` - Server initialization with capabilities
- `tools/*` - Tool listing and execution (memory_search, memory_create, system_status)
- `resources/*` - Resource access (analytics, performance metrics)
- `prompts/*` - Prompt template management
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming

**✅ Security & Session Management**
- Origin validation (localhost only)
- UUID-based session lifecycle management
- Comprehensive JSON-RPC message validation
- Structured error responses with proper error codes

**✅ Integration & Testing**
- Complete integration with Memory Intelligence System
- Integration with Performance API monitoring
- Comprehensive test suite with all tests passing
- Production validation with health check endpoints
