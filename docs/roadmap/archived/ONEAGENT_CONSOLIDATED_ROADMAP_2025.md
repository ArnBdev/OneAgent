## üîç **FEATURES EXCLUDED FROM ROADMAP**

**Excluded due to low confidence or unclear value:**
- Complex workflow automation (insufficient user research)
- Advanced UI customization (not core to OneAgent mission)
- External API integrations (dependency risk)
- Experimental AI model integrations (stability risk)

**Reasoning**: These features either lack clear implementation paths, introduce significant risk, or don't align with OneAgent's core mission of quality-first development assistance.
