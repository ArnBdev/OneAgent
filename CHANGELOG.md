# 📝 OneAgent v4.2.2 Professional - Changelog

## v4.2.3 (Unreleased) — Canonical Pluggable Memory System, MCP/JSON-RPC Compliance

### 🧠 Memory System Refactor

- Canonical memory system is now fully pluggable and MCP/JSON-RPC-compliant.
- All memory operations route through `OneAgentMemory` singleton, which delegates to a backend-specific `IMemoryClient` implementation (`Mem0MemoryClient`, `MemgraphMemoryClient`).
- No parallel/legacy code remains; all logic is routed through the canonical interface.
- Strict interface contract enforced via `coreagent/memory/clients/IMemoryClient.ts`.
- Provider selection via config/env (`provider` or `ONEAGENT_MEMORY_PROVIDER`).
- Event-driven updates and health monitoring supported.
- See new documentation: `docs/memory-system-architecture.md`.

### 🔒 Integrity

- No parallel time/ID/cache/memory systems introduced. All memory, cache, and ID/time operations use canonical services only.

### 📖 Documentation

- Added `docs/memory-system-architecture.md` for canonical memory system design, usage, and migration guidance.

### ✨ Features

- Canonical structured `agent_execution_result` emissions (success/failure) centralized in `BaseAgent` with idempotency guard.
- Added task lifecycle timestamps (`dispatchedAt`, `completedAt`) and derived `durationMs` in `TaskDelegationService` (anti-parallel: all timestamps via `createUnifiedTimestamp()`).
- Orchestrator now measures dispatch→completion latency and passes `durationMs` to delegation + monitoring pipeline.
- Background requeue scheduler added (env-gated via `ONEAGENT_REQUEUE_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MS`) to periodically invoke `processDueRequeues()` outside of plan execution; provides steady retry waves without manual triggers.

### 📊 Observability

- Per-terminal task broadcast of `operation_metrics_snapshot` containing avg/p95/p99/errorRate for `TaskDelegation.execute` sourced from canonical `PerformanceMonitor` (no shadow histograms).
- Added `HybridAgentOrchestrator.getLatestOperationMetricsSnapshot()` for programmatic retrieval.
- Extended metrics export allowlist to include `TaskDelegation.execute` so latency gauges (avg/p95/p99) are exposed consistently alongside other canonical operations (JSON + Prometheus exposition paths). No parallel metrics stores introduced; all figures derive from `unifiedMonitoringService.trackOperation` → `PerformanceMonitor`.

### 🔁 Reliability & Retry

- Introduced explicit `processDueRequeues()` scanning failed tasks with elapsed backoff to requeue automatically and integrated it with the new background scheduler. Test coverage extended (see 🧪 Testing).
- Added negative/edge tests for malformed or duplicate structured emissions (`agent-execution-negative.test.ts`).
- Implemented exponential backoff with nextAttempt scheduling metadata (`nextAttemptUnix`/`nextAttemptAt`) and added multi-requeue ordering guarantees.

### 🧪 Testing

- Added a minimal Jest-like harness (`tests/canonical/jest-mini-globals.ts`) and runner to ensure A2A smoke tests execute reliably without global jest context; direct run now passes via the harness.
- New tests:
  - `coreagent/tests/agent-execution-fuzz.test.ts` — fuzz invalid `AgentExecutionResult` payloads and validate listener robustness.
  - `coreagent/tests/mission-progress-invariant.test.ts` — invariant on mission progress accounting across dispatched/completed/failed.
  - `coreagent/tests/multi-requeue-ordering.test.ts` — ensures deterministic behavior and no duplication when multiple tasks become eligible for requeue.
- Expanded coverage verifying latency capture and metrics snapshots end-to-end.

### 📖 Documentation

- Updated `A2A_PROTOCOL_IMPLEMENTATION.md` with structured emission schema, latency flow, snapshot example, failure semantics, and backward compatibility notes.

### 🔍 Integrity

- No parallel time, ID, cache, or metrics systems introduced. Performance data sourced exclusively via `unifiedMonitoringService.trackOperation` → `PerformanceMonitor` ingestion.

### 🧭 Scheduling & Shutdown

- Orchestrator now starts a background requeue scheduler when enabled via env; graceful shutdown sequence stops the scheduler to avoid orphaned timers and ensures clean process exit.

### ⚠️ Deprecations

- `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_REAL_AGENT_EXECUTION` auto-migrated to `ONEAGENT_SIMULATE_AGENT_EXECUTION` with a one-time persisted deprecation notice stored via canonical memory. Runtime continues using the canonical flag.

### 🚧 Deferred

- Additional negative fuzz cases for broader schema coverage (beyond current corpus).

## v4.2.2 (Current) — Mission Metrics Export, Unified Cache Policy, Discovery Backoff, and Web Findings Caching

### 📦 Tooling / Version

- Upgraded package manager pin from `npm@11.0.0` → `npm@11.6.0` (minor improvements & fixes within same major). `engines.npm` kept as minimum (>=11.0.0).

### 📊 Observability

- Prometheus mission gauges documented & test covered (`prometheusMissionMetrics.test.ts`).
- Added mission snapshot fields into `anomaly_alert` `details` for richer context (active/completed/cancelled/errors/avgDurationMs/totalTerminated where relevant).

### 🧪 Testing

- Added lightweight Prometheus export assertion test validating presence of mission gauge metrics.

### 🧬 Code Generation Upgrade

- `generate-mission-control-types.ts` now emits named interfaces per variant (e.g., `Outbound_mission_update`) improving IDE discoverability & narrowing.
- Regenerated `mission-control-message-types.ts` with interface blocks + safer discriminant guards (no `as any`).

### 📖 Documentation

- `MISSION_CONTROL_WS.md` updated with a dedicated Mission Metrics section enumerating each gauge and design rationale (derivational, no parallel counters).

### 🔍 Integrity

- No parallel state introduced; all derived metrics continue to source from mission registry snapshot and monitoring services.

### 🔄 Deferred Post 4.2.2

- Adaptive anomaly heuristics (EWMA/stddev windows).
- JSDoc enrichment pulling schema descriptions into generated interfaces.
- Guard factory helpers (generic `isOutboundType<'...'>`).
- Extended negative schema fuzz tests for outbound variants.

### 🗄️ Canonical Cache & Discovery (Consolidation)

- Enforced single canonical cache usage across cross‑cutting concerns via `OneAgentUnifiedBackbone.getInstance().cache`.
- Discovery now backed by unified cache with TTL/backoff:
  - Configurable TTLs: `ONEAGENT_DISCOVERY_TTL_MS` (found results) and `ONEAGENT_DISCOVERY_TTL_EMPTY_MS` (empty results) to reduce churn in CI while keeping dev fresh.
  - Emits `discovery_delta` events only when topology changes to reduce log noise; supplemented by env‑gated comm log level.
  - Cycle‑safe dynamic imports used in `UnifiedAgentCommunicationService` to avoid initialization order issues.
- Added cache health details to system health reporting; health endpoints derive exclusively from canonical services.

### 🔎 Web Findings — Unified Cache + Negative Caching

- Migrated `WebFindingsManager` caching to the unified cache with write‑through semantics and per‑item TTL.
- Deterministic cache keys:
  - `webfindings:search:id:${id}`, `webfindings:fetch:id:${id}`
  - Query/url indices: `webfindings:q:${md5(query)}`, `webfindings:u:${md5(url)}`
- Optional local in‑process maps retained only as transient indices and fully disable‑able via `ONEAGENT_WEBFINDINGS_DISABLE_LOCAL_CACHE=1` (default relies on unified cache).
- Introduced negative caching for no‑result queries with `ONEAGENT_WEBFINDINGS_NEG_TTL_MS` to curb repeated upstream calls without creating stale positives.

### 🧰 Developer Experience & Logging

- Communication log verbosity is env‑tunable; discovery logs quiet by default unless level increased.
- Documentation and Dev chatmode updated with a canonical cache policy quickref and env flags.

### 🗎 Docs & Chatmode Alignment

- `AGENTS.md` reinforced unified cache policy and discovery/web findings env guidance.
- `ONEAGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` expanded with: discovery caching/backoff, health thresholds, discovery signals/logging, unified cache health, and web findings negative‑cache policy.
- Dev chatmode updated to reflect anti‑parallel guardrails and unified cache quickref.

### ✅ Integrity (Reiterated)

- No parallel time/ID/cache/memory systems introduced. All caching now routes through the unified cache. Health/metrics derive from canonical services only.

---

## v4.2.1 — Anomaly Alerts & Mission Metrics Prep

### 🚨 anomaly_alert Channel (Mission Control)

- Added `anomaly_alert` outbound schema variant & channel implementation (interval evaluator).
- Heuristics (initial transparent rules):
  - Active missions >10 (warning) / >25 (critical).
  - Error rate >30% (warning) / >50% (critical) once ≥5 terminated missions.
- Emits: `category`, `severity`, `message`, plus optional `metric`, `value`, `threshold`, `details`.
- Zero parallel metrics store: derives exclusively from mission registry snapshot & existing monitoring events.

### 🧪 Type & Schema Sync

- Regenerated mission-control types to include `anomaly_alert` (codegen pipeline unchanged; guard post-processed to remove unsafe casts).
- Outbound schema updated (`mission-control-outbound-messages.schema.json`) with anomaly_alert object.

### 📊 Upcoming Mission Metrics (Scaffolding)

- Version bump reserved groundwork for Prometheus mission metrics (planned derivational gauges from registry on scrape; no persistent counters introduced yet).
- Documentation updates pending for Prometheus section once gauges are added.
- IMPLEMENTED (post-initial 4.2.1 commit): Prometheus endpoint now exposes derived mission gauges (`oneagent_mission_active`, `oneagent_mission_completed`, `oneagent_mission_cancelled`, `oneagent_mission_errors`, `oneagent_mission_total`, `oneagent_mission_avg_duration_ms`, `oneagent_mission_error_rate`). Zero parallel counters — all values derived on demand from mission registry snapshot.

### 🔍 Integrity & Architecture

- All additions use canonical ID/time functions, mission registry, and `unifiedMonitoringService.trackOperation`.
- No new global singletons or caches; interval evaluators are per-subscriber and cleaned up on unsubscribe/connection dispose.

### 🔄 Follow-Up (Deferred Post 4.2.1)

- Prometheus mission metrics export (active/completed/cancelled/errors, avg duration, error rate gauges).
- Adaptive anomaly heuristics (sliding window + standard deviation / EWMA based thresholds).
- Named TS interfaces per outbound variant via codegen enhancement (interface emission with doc comments).

---

## v4.2.0 — Mission Control Streaming, Type-Safe Schema Codegen & AI Client Hardening

### 🌐 Mission Control WebSocket (Streaming Foundations)

- Introduced dedicated Mission Control WS endpoint with modular channel registry and JSON Schema–validated inbound/outbound frames.
- Channels implemented: `metrics_tick`, `health_delta`, and new mission lifecycle stream (`mission_update`) plus consolidated stats channel `mission_stats`.
- Full lifecycle statuses: `planning_started`, `tasks_generated`, `planned`, `execution_started`, `execution_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `error`.
- Added cancellation support via `mission_cancel` inbound command (gracefully stops execution engine & records terminal state).
- Outbound schema consolidation: expanded mission_update status union and added distinct `mission_stats` schema variant.

### 📊 Mission Registry (Ephemeral O(1) Aggregation)

- Added in-memory mission registry tracking start time, last status, terminal status, durationMs, and error details.
- Provides snapshot aggregates for `mission_stats` (active, completed, cancelled, errors, avgDurationMs, total).
- Zero parallel cache counters: removed placeholder cache key lookups; registry is the authoritative ephemeral source.
- Test coverage: `missionRegistry.test.ts` validates multi-mission aggregation & terminal status classification.

### 🧬 Schema → Type Generation Pipeline

- Added `scripts/generate-mission-control-types.ts` producing discriminated unions for inbound/outbound mission control messages.
- Generated file: `mission-control-message-types.ts` (no `any`, includes type guards per variant) with drift detection script `codegen:mission-control:check`.
- Coverage test ensures all lifecycle statuses and `mission_stats` variant present (prevents silent schema drift).

### 🧪 Validation & Observability Enhancements

- Runtime outbound validation integrated into send wrapper; invalid frames blocked before network transmission.
- Monitoring instrumentation for mission lifecycle transitions & mission stats emission (`MissionStats.emit`).
- Mission completion / cancellation / error events now emit durationMs via unified monitoring service.

### 🛡️ Lint & Quality

- Eliminated all residual `as any` casts post-codegen; strict ESLint passes with zero warnings.
- Added precise status union narrowing in mission handler monkey patch (completion observer) without weakening types.

### 🧩 AI Client Modernization (Carried from in-progress scope)

- Gemini client migration & monitoring instrumentation (see prior v4.2.0 in-progress notes) finalized under current release.

### 🔄 Follow-Up (Deferred Post 4.2.0)

- Mission Control: anomaly detection channel (`anomaly_alert`) & authenticated channel access.
- Prometheus integration for mission stats (derive gauges from registry on scrape, no new store).
- Richer `execution_progress` payload (per-task metadata, ETA, cumulative completion percent).
- Named interfaces in generated types for each schema variant + docstring propagation.
- Runtime schema fuzz tests (negative case generation) for hardened validation.

### 🤖 Gemini Migration Hardening & Instrumentation

- Completed migration off deprecated `@google/generative-ai` (now guarded to prevent reintroduction).
- `SmartGeminiClient` now emits canonical monitoring operations:
  - `AI/gemini_wrapper_generate` (success|error)
  - `AI/gemini_direct_generate` (success|error) with attempts, transient classification, fallback state.
- Added structured retry/backoff for direct path (exponential + jitter) with transient error classification.
- Added model + path metadata in monitoring events (no parallel metric store; uses `unifiedMonitoringService.trackOperation`).
- Introduced safe text extraction helper + duration metadata for last attempt.
- Pinned `@google/genai` to `1.20.0` (no caret) for reproducible builds.

### 🧪 Batch Memory Determinism (Test Stability)

- `BatchMemoryOperations` gained deterministic test flags:
  - `ONEAGENT_BATCH_DETERMINISTIC=1` → microtask flush (timer=0ms) for stable ordering.
  - `ONEAGENT_BATCH_IMMEDIATE_FLUSH=1` → synchronous batch processing for unit tests.
- Added `__testForceProcess()` helper (explicitly internal) to enable targeted flush without timing races.
- Ensures memory-related suites on low-resource hardware avoid flaky timing dependent waits.

### 🛡️ Dependency Guardrails

- New `scripts/guard-deprecated-deps.cjs` integrated into `verify` & `precommit`:
  - Bans `@google/generative-ai` package & legacy symbols `GoogleGenerativeAI`, `GenerativeModel`.
  - Scans `coreagent/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/` directories.

### 📦 Dependency Updates (Selective Non-Breaking)

- Pinned / upgraded (non-breaking):
  - `chalk` 5.6.2, `chromadb` 3.0.15, `dotenv` 16.6.1, `mem0ai` 2.1.38, `openai` 5.22.0, `ws` 8.18.3.
  - Dev: `@tailwindcss/postcss` 4.1.13, `@types/express` 4.17.23, `@types/node` 22.18.6, `ts-jest` 29.4.4, `vite` 7.1.7.
- Rationale: security/bug fixes, improved editor types, alignment with existing major versions (no API changes consumed by OneAgent).

### 🔍 Integrity & Canonical Guarantees

- All new instrumentation funnels through existing monitoring service; no parallel counters or latency arrays created.
- Retry logic does not persist state outside the SmartGeminiClient instance; all durations reported via canonical `trackOperation` path.
- Batch determinism flags alter scheduling only; write path remains canonical via `addMemoryCanonical`.

### 📌 Follow-Up (Deferred)

- Potential centralized AI model configuration map (single source for allowed models / capabilities).
- Add Prometheus AI latency gauges derived from existing monitoring events (derivational, not new store).
- Additional test utilities consolidating batch flag toggling + memory readiness in a shared helper.

## v4.1.1 (Maintenance) — Version sync + Tailwind 4.1 consolidation

### 🔢 Version & Manifest Sync

- Bumped repository version to 4.1.1 in `package.json` and `mcp-manifest.json`.
- Updated README header to v4.1.1.

### 🖌️ UI Tooling: Tailwind 4.1 alignment

- Ensured Tailwind v4.1 series across the workspace:
  - Root devDependency `@tailwindcss/postcss` set to ^4.1.0.
  - Root `tailwindcss` remains ^4.1.12 (latest 4.1.x at time of change).
  - UI workspace continues with Tailwind CSS 4.x via Vite 7. See Tailwind v4.1 notes for performance and DX improvements.
- PostCSS config uses the v4 plugin (`@tailwindcss/postcss`) consistent with Tailwind 4 documentation.

References:

- Tailwind Plus announcement: https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwind-plus
- Tailwind CSS v4.1: https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-1
- Vite usage: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite

No behavior changes to UI styles are expected; this is a dependency alignment to keep us current.

## v4.1.0 (Maintenance) — Canonical System Health + Readiness

### 🏥 SystemHealthTool Canonicalization

- Switched SystemHealthTool to canonical error handling via `getUnifiedErrorHandler().handleError(...)` (no static references).
- Version now sourced from `getAppVersion()`; timestamp/IDs via unified helpers.
- Added `operationSummary` powered by canonical monitoring aggregation (`UnifiedBackboneService.monitoring.summarizeOperationMetrics`) — no parallel counters.
- Performance metrics now come from `UnifiedMonitoringService.getPerformanceMetrics()` (CPU, memory, latency p95/p99, throughput, quality/compliance).
- MCP health details now derived from `getUnifiedMCPClient().getHealth()` (status, response time, error rate, active connections, cache hit rate, server list).
- Removed illustrative/placeholder counts and unused locals; tightened types. Public tool name unchanged: `oneagent_system_health`.

Documentation: API reference updated to reflect enriched response (`healthMetrics.overall/components` + `operationSummary`).

### ⏱️ Memory Readiness Helpers + Test Stabilization

- Added `OneAgentMemory.ready()` (GET `/readyz`) and `waitForReady(totalTimeoutMs, intervalMs)` polling helper.
- NLACS persistence test updated to poll readiness and gracefully skip when memory backend is unavailable; reduces flakes under CI.
- README Testing section now notes readiness behavior for persistence-style tests.

Integrity: No parallel systems introduced; all new data flows through canonical backbones (UnifiedMonitoringService, UnifiedBackboneService, unified MCP client, OneAgentMemory).

### 🛠️ Toolchain Consolidation (Modernize & Deduplicate)

- Unified Vite to 7.1.5 at the root; removed secondary Vite from `ui/` to avoid multi-major hoisting conflicts.
- Upgraded TypeScript to 5.9.2 (root) and aligned UI tooling to use the same compiler.
- Upgraded ESLint to 9.35 and `@typescript-eslint/*` to 8.39 for compatibility.
- Upgraded `@vitejs/plugin-react` to 5.x to match Vite 7.
- VS Code extension: bumped TypeScript to 5.9, ESLint to 9, `@types/vscode` to latest (no legacy editor support required).
- Removed duplicate frontend libraries from the root (`react`, `react-dom`, `clsx`, `class-variance-authority`, `lucide-react`) to keep UI dependencies isolated under `ui/`.
- Verified: type-check, lint, runtime smoke, toolsets E2E, and stdio framing all pass.

### 🧰 CI/Docs Minor Additions (Windows parity)

- CI: Added Windows readiness-gated NLACS persistence job mirroring Linux (starts memory server, polls `/readyz`, runs NLACS persistence test, cleans up).
- Docs: README adds a quick link to `tests/README.md` for the readiness-gated persistence test quickstart.

## v4.0.2 - 2025-08-16

## v4.0.7 - 2025-09-01

## v4.0.8 - 2025-09-03

### 🔁 Proactive Delegation Reliability (Retry & Failure Taxonomy Groundwork)

- Added task retry foundation (attempts / maxAttempts, env `ONEAGENT_TASK_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, default 3).
- New monitoring operations: `retry`, `retry_exhausted` (documented in OPERATION_METRICS.md).
- Structured dispatch failure integration (`no_target_agent`) now triggers controlled re-queue until exhaustion.
- Snapshot persistence throttled (15s) to reduce memory churn while maintaining audit trail fidelity.
- Execution path refactored behind `executeDelegatedTask` for upcoming real remediation actions (Epic 8).

### 📊 Task Delegation Observability Enhancements (Post-Retry Additions)

- Added Prometheus gauges `oneagent_task_delegation_status_total{status}` and `oneagent_task_delegation_backoff_pending` (derivational from in‑memory queue; zero parallel store).
- Created integration test `task-delegation-metrics.exposition.test.ts` validating new gauges.
- Implemented test/runtime guards: conditional unified server autostart skip under `NODE_ENV=test` / `ONEAGENT_FAST_TEST_MODE` / `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_AUTOSTART`.
- Suppressed non‑essential console logging in `ToolRegistry` & `EmbeddingCacheService` under FAST_TEST_MODE to eliminate post‑Jest asynchronous logging warnings.
- Added embedding cache init short‑circuit for tests preventing background timer noise.
- Updated `OPERATION_METRICS.md` with new delegation gauges (already canonical metrics doc) — no further doc drift.
- Result: Stable, noise‑free test runs; observability coverage for queue health & backoff saturation.

### 🕰️ Execution Latency: Gauge inclusion & immediate removal of legacy op

- Ingested `durationMs` from `TaskDelegation.execute` events into the canonical `PerformanceMonitor` and exposed per-operation latency gauges for `execute` (avg / p95 / p99) via the Prometheus endpoint. Added integration test `task-delegation-execute-latency.metrics.test.ts` to validate exposition.
- The legacy `TaskDelegation.execute_latency` emission has been removed from the engine to keep a single, cleaner metric emission path. Emitters must include `durationMs` on `trackOperation('TaskDelegation','execute',...)` calls. Consumers should rely on `oneagent_operation_latency_avg_ms{operation="execute"}` and p95/p99 gauges.

### 🧩 Documentation & Version Synchronization

- Bumped README, package.json, and changelog headers to v4.0.8 (v4.0.7 was already published/tagged).
- Metrics doc updated with retry operations and throttled snapshot description.
- Added delegation status/backoff Prometheus gauge documentation.

### ✅ Integrity

### 🔒 Monitoring Test Hardening & Purity Guards (Post 4.0.8 Incremental)

- Added derivational purity & cardinality test: `prometheus-exposition.purity.test.ts` (ensures metrics endpoint does not mutate latency state & bounds `errorCode` label set).
- Added global performance report test: `performance-global-report.test.ts` validating p95/p99 ordering and recommendation triggers for high tail latency.
- Added percentile eviction drift test: `percentile-drift.eviction.test.ts` confirming monotonic p95/p99 under high-tail sample injection + rolling eviction.
- Added Prometheus snapshot name stability test: `prometheus-snapshot.test.ts` preventing silent removal of canonical metric names.
- Updated Jest config to run setup after environment initialization (`setupFilesAfterEnv`) fixing lifecycle guards for purity tests.
- Expanded `OPERATION_METRICS.md` Validation & Test Coverage table with new tests; backlog updated (removed implemented snapshot/cardinality/eviction items; added fuzz & mutation tests).
- Strengthened anti-regression surface for metrics exposition (naming, label cardinality, derivational purity) – reduces risk of accidental parallel store introduction or label explosion.

- All changes reuse canonical monitoring + memory systems; no parallel persistence or metrics stores introduced.
- Type + lint verification clean.

### 🔧 Incremental Observability & NLACS Enhancements (post-tag additions kept under 4.0.7)

- Implemented error budget burn & remaining gauges: `oneagent_slo_error_budget_burn`, `oneagent_slo_error_budget_remaining` plus JSON `errorBudgets` array (derived from SLO targets vs observed opSummary — no parallel state).
- Implemented optional semantic analysis exposure flag (`includeSemanticAnalysis`) in `ChatAPI` returning intent, entities, sentiment, complexity, model version.
- Introduced SLO target gauges from `slo.config.json` (`oneagent_slo_target_latency_ms`, `oneagent_slo_target_error_rate`).
- Refactored Prometheus metrics export to single `esc` helper; avoided parallel metric state.
- Extended tests (`metricsEndpoints.test.ts`) covering taxonomy error codes, SLO gauges, histograms, error budget burn gauges, JSON errorBudgets presence.
- Added baseline `EntityExtractionService` (pattern-based) and integrated into `ChatAPI` semantic analysis replacing empty entities placeholder.
- Completed taxonomy propagation across handlers, unified error system, monitoring events, and metrics.
- Roadmap updated: histogram + entity extraction items marked complete ahead of schedule; Monitoring & Metrics pillar status advanced to Enhanced.
- Ensured zero duplication of metric stores; all derivations pull from canonical monitoring + config.
- Placeholder entity extraction integration test added; future ML upgrade will keep interface stable.
- Roadmap delta applied: Immediate Action Queue items 7 & 8 marked Done (ref. docs/roadmap.md v1.0.2).

### 🤖 Proactive Delegation Pipeline (Epic 7) – INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION

- Consolidated proactive snapshot → triage → deep analysis → task harvesting under unified `ProactiveTriageOrchestrator` (no parallel observer service).
- Introduced `TaskDelegationService` with bounded in-memory queue (MAX=100) + signature-based dedup (`snapshotHash::action`).
- Added environment flags:
  - `ONEAGENT_PROACTIVE_OBSERVER` (enable orchestrator)
  - `ONEAGENT_PROACTIVE_AUTO_DELEGATE` (auto-harvest recommendedActions)
  - `ONEAGENT_PROACTIVE_INTERVAL_MS` (observation cycle base interval)
  - `ONEAGENT_TASK_DISPATCH_INTERVAL_MS` (dispatch loop base interval; jitter applied)
- Engine dispatch loop added (`startTaskDispatchLoop`) emitting operations: `dispatch_loop`, `dispatch_cycle`, `dispatch_mark`, `dispatch`, `dispatch_latency`.
- Metrics documentation (`OPERATION_METRICS.md`) extended with Task Delegation operations (zero new metric stores, reuses canonical monitoring pipeline).
- Canonical ID/time usage: all tasks created with `createUnifiedId` + `createUnifiedTimestamp`; no `Date.now()` or ad-hoc IDs introduced.
- Memory persistence: Each queued task + status transition stored via `addMemoryCanonical` (auditable without alternate persistence layer).
- Added queue restoration & snapshot persistence (restart resilience stage 1):
  - `restore` operation metric (success/error) emitted when reconstructing queue from prior `ProactiveDelegation:*` memory records.
  - Opportunistic lightweight snapshots (`TaskDelegationSnapshot`) persisted after execution/state transitions (no parallel store; pure audit trail).
  - Public `taskDelegationService.restore()` helper added for deterministic test initialization.
- New test: `task-restore.persistence.test.ts` validates synthetic memory records are restored into in-memory queue.
- Structured dispatch failure groundwork: `markDispatchFailure` emits `dispatch` error with stable `errorCode` (e.g. `no_target_agent`, `execution_error`).
- Engine now invokes `markDispatchFailure` when no target agent can be inferred (emits `dispatch` error with `no_target_agent`). Added `executeDelegatedTask` helper to isolate future remediation logic.
- Introduced retry groundwork: tasks carry `attempts` / `maxAttempts` (env `ONEAGENT_TASK_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, default 3); failed dispatch (e.g. `no_target_agent`) triggers `retry` events until exhaustion emits `retry_exhausted`.
- Snapshot writes now throttled (min 15s between persisted snapshots) to reduce memory churn while retaining audit fidelity.
- Added enhanced smoke test `proactive-delegation.loop.test.ts` asserting queue + dispatch marking behavior.
- Production & example `.env` updated with proactive flags (safeguarded defaults set to disabled).

Follow-Up (Deferred to Epic 8):

- Actual remediation execution (agent action invocation + result metrics).
- Failure classification (`errorCode` taxonomy for dispatch failures).
- Persistent task store for restart resilience (will extend canonical memory schema, not a parallel queue).

### 🚀 Follow-Up (Planned Under 4.0.7 Maintenance Window)

- Prototype anomaly detection events (latency deviation) feeding future alert pack.
- Upgrade entity extraction to ML NER behind current service contract.
- Documentation expansion for SLO/error budget methodology (add to `OPERATION_METRICS.md`).

### 🔄 Communication Persistence Consolidation COMPLETE

- Added `CommunicationPersistenceAdapter` centralizing writes for:
  - Agent messages, discussions, discussion contributions
  - Insights, synthesized knowledge, agent status
  - Tasks (`persistTask`) & discussion aggregate updates (`persistDiscussionUpdate`)
- Removed legacy internal helpers: `storeA2AMemory`, `storeTaskInMemory` (eliminated parallel metadata construction path).
- Refactored `A2AProtocol` to delegate all persistence to adapter; standardized metadata keys via `COMM_METADATA_KEYS`.
- Introduced canonical task & discussion update persistence ensuring search continuity while preventing schema drift.

### 📊 Observability Enhancements

- Instrumentation coverage: 100% of `COMM_OPERATION` operations (send, broadcast, discussions, insights, knowledge, patterns, status, context retrieval).
- Prometheus endpoint extended with per-operation latency gauges: `oneagent_operation_latency_avg_ms`, `p95_ms`, `p99_ms` (labels: component, operation).
- Added per-operation error counters metric: `oneagent_operation_errors_total{component,operation,errorCode}` (derived directly from unified monitoring event stream — no parallel metrics state introduced).
- Parallelized detailed latency metric retrieval (Promise.all) reducing metrics endpoint response overhead as operations scale.
- New smoke tests:
  - `communication.metrics.prometheus.test.ts` (latency gauges + labels)
  - `operation-error-metrics.smoke.test.ts` (error counter exposure + errorCode label)

### 🧹 Deletions / Pruning

- Removed obsolete wrapper: `OneAgentMemoryMemoryClient.ts` (unused IMemoryClient shim).
- Removed all ad-hoc A2A persistence logic replaced by adapter calls.

### 🧭 Follow-Up (Open)

- Surface structured communication error taxonomy metrics (normalize / classify `errorCode`).
- Expand documentation (`OPERATION_METRICS.md`) to include new error counter semantics & usage guidance.
- Add adapter-level tests for `persistTask` / `persistDiscussionUpdate` metadata invariants (optional hardening).

---

- A2A: Default protocol bumped to 0.2.6; serve dual well-known endpoints on MCP server:
  - `/.well-known/agent-card.json` (preferred for A2A >= 0.3.0)
  - `/.well-known/agent.json` (legacy for A2A 0.2.x)
- Docs: README now documents A2A well-known endpoints and adds a short 0.3.0 interop plan.
- Demo: Added `npm run demo:hello` (non-invasive runtime check of MCP /health, /info, JSON-RPC initialize, tools/list, SSE heartbeat).
- CI/Workflows: Release workflows consolidated; ready to publish from tag.

## v4.0.1 - 2025-08-16

- scripts/runtime-smoke.ts: Load `.env` in the runtime smoke harness; add SSE probe for `/mcp`; add an optional authenticated memory `/v1/memories/stats` check when `MEM0_API_KEY` is present to exercise read-only memory endpoints without modifying state.
- scripts/start-oneagent-system.ps1: Clarify `.env` usage in the startup banner; probe memory `/health` for readiness instead of root; print quick visibility for `MEM0_API_KEY` to aid debugging.
- Misc: Push includes related monitoring and canonicalization improvements consolidated into `main` (see pushed commit for details).

## ♻️ **[2025-08-10] Canonical Memory Write Path Finalization**

### ✅ Deprecated Path Removed

- Removed legacy `addMemory(data: object)` implementation and supporting `performAddMemory` + sanitization-only legacy flow.
- All memory writes now funneled through `addMemoryCanonical(content, metadata, userId)` (ergonomic alias `addMemory` retained pointing to canonical).

### 🧩 Batch & Tool Migration

- `BatchMemoryOperations` now transforms queued operations into UnifiedMetadata and invokes canonical writer.
- Tools migrated: `webSearch`, `geminiEmbeddings`, `SimpleTestContent` (test harness) to canonical metadata service.

### 🛠 Structural Improvements

- Introduced typed `BatchOperationResult` / `BatchOperationError` replacing `any[]`.
- Added new test `tests/memory/batch-canonical-metadata.test.ts` validating batch canonicalization path.

### 📐 Rationale

Eliminating the legacy polymorphic payload path enforces a single, analyzable metadata schema (UnifiedMetadata), unlocking reliable analytics, learning engines, and future adaptive search improvements without adapter proliferation.

### 🚦 Follow-Up (Optional)

- Potential simplification of `adaptSearchResponse` once server guarantees unified shape.
- Expand test coverage for search result metadata round‑trip.

### 🧪 Monitoring Import Optimization

- Added `ONEAGENT_DISABLE_AUTO_MONITORING` environment flag to suppress automatic monitoring instantiation for short-lived scripts/tests.
- Converted monitoring timers to use `unref()` so they no longer keep the Node.js event loop alive.

### 🔗 Communication Consolidation & Monitoring Operation Field

- Introduced `UnifiedAgentCommunicationService` singleton as sole A2A pathway (repaired prior corruption, wrapped all public methods with `runSafely`).
- Added deprecation guard stubs (`DeprecatedCommunication.ts`) for legacy class names preventing parallel system reintroduction.
- Implemented conformance test (`communication-conformance.test.ts`) validating canonical flow & absence of legacy patterns.
- Added explicit `operation` field to `MonitoringEvent` schema; `trackOperation` now records durations and exposes op names (more reliable than substring matching on message).
- Added rate limit enforcement test (`communication-rate-limit.test.ts`) covering 30 messages / 60s constraint.
- Enhanced `verify-build.js` to run communication tests and output observed operations.
