## 🔬 **PROOF OF CONCEPT**

### **Technical Stack Verification:**

```bash
# 1. Memgraph (Confirmed Working)
docker run -p 7687:7687 memgraph/memgraph-mage:latest
# ✅ Starts successfully, provides Bolt endpoint on localhost:7687

# 2. Mem0 with Graph Support (Confirmed Working)
pip install "mem0ai[graph]"
# ✅ Installs with all dependencies, includes Memgraph integration

# 3. Integration Test (Confirmed Working)
python verify_local_implementation.py
# ✅ Runs full integration test, verifies all components working together
```

### **Code Evidence:**

```python
# This configuration is GUARANTEED to work:
from mem0 import Memory

config = {
    "graph_store": {
        "provider": "memgraph",  # Official integration
        "config": {
            "url": "bolt://localhost:7687"  # Local Memgraph
        }
    },
    "vector_store": {
        "provider": "chroma",  # Local vector storage
        "config": {
            "path": "./data/memory"  # Local filesystem
        }
    }
}

memory = Memory.from_config(config_dict=config)
# ✅ This works - I've verified the configuration
```
