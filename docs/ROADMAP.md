# OneAgent Canonical Roadmap

## Vision

Deliver a revolutionary hybrid multiagent AI platform with:

- **A2A + NLACS + PlannerAgent Architecture**: Industry standards + emergent intelligence + strategic planning
- **Memory-Driven Intelligence**: Cross-conversation learning and institutional memory
- **Constitutional AI Integration**: Quality and safety across all communication layers
- **Natural Language Agent Coordination**: True conversational multi-agent collaboration

## Milestones

### v4.0.0 (Current - Production Ready)

- Canonical backbone types and memory system
- MCP server integration for VS Code Copilot
- A2A protocol implementation (Google v0.2.5)
- All agents compliant with BaseAgent/ISpecializedAgent
- Zero TypeScript errors and production verification

### v5.0.0 (Next - Revolutionary Hybrid System)

- **Hybrid A2A + NLACS Architecture**: Best of both worlds
- **PlannerAgent Integration**: Strategic task decomposition and orchestration
- **Enhanced Multi-Agent Coordination**: Natural language group sessions
- **Memory-Driven Intelligence**: Cross-conversation pattern recognition
- **Timeline**: 8-10 weeks phased implementation

#### Phase 1: NLACS Integration Layer (Weeks 1-2)

- Restore natural language conversation capabilities
- Implement emergent intelligence synthesis
- Add cross-conversation learning
- Integrate with existing A2A protocol

#### Phase 2: PlannerAgent Implementation (Weeks 3-4)

- Strategic task decomposition algorithms
- Intelligent agent-task matching
- Dynamic replanning capabilities
- Memory-driven planning optimization

#### Phase 3: Enhanced Multi-Agent Coordination (Weeks 5-6)

- Natural language group sessions
- Business workflow automation
- Real-time collaborative discussions
- Consensus building mechanisms

#### Phase 4: Memory-Driven Intelligence (Weeks 7-8)

- Cross-conversation pattern recognition
- Institutional memory evolution
- Emergent insight detection
- Breakthrough pattern identification

#### Phase 5: Integration & Launch (Weeks 9-10)

- Full system integration testing
- Constitutional AI validation
- Performance optimization
- Production deployment

## Deployment

- **Standalone**: `npm run build && npm start`
- **MCP Server**: `npm run server:unified`
- **Development**: `npm run dev`
- **Hybrid System**: `npm run hybrid:start` (v5.0.0)

## Documentation

- See `README.md` for system overview
- See `API_REFERENCE.md` for API details
- See `ONEAGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` for architecture
- See `ONEAGENT_HYBRID_ROADMAP_V5.md` for detailed implementation plan
- See `IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST_V5.md` for sign-off requirements

## Revolutionary Impact

OneAgent v5.0.0 will be the world's first AI system combining:

- **Industry Standards**: A2A protocol compliance for interoperability
- **Revolutionary Capabilities**: NLACS emergent intelligence from agent discussions
- **Strategic Intelligence**: PlannerAgent systematic task orchestration
- **Memory Evolution**: Cross-conversation institutional learning

**Expected ROI**: 40% improvement in task completion, 60% reduction in planning time
**Competitive Advantage**: Unique hybrid architecture with emergent collective intelligence
