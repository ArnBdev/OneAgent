# OneAgent Canonical Architecture & Vision Document

## 1. Vision & Purpose

OneAgent is a professional-grade, modular, and extensible multiagent platform designed to deliver advanced AI-powered development, orchestration, and memory intelligence. It is both a standalone multiagent system (with future plans for a dedicated GUI) and a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for VS Code and other clients. OneAgent is built to be:
- The canonical reference for hybrid A2A (Agent-to-Agent) and MCP (RESTful, distributed) architectures.
- A platform for Constitutional AI, BMAD-driven analysis, and quality-first development.
- A foundation for both local and distributed agent collaboration, memory, and orchestration.

## 2. Core Technologies & Dependencies

- **TypeScript (strict mode):** All core logic, interfaces, and orchestration.
- **Node.js v22+**: Runtime environment.
- **MCP Protocol v4.0+**: RESTful, JSON-RPC 2.0, canonical for distributed agent registry, discovery, and memory.
- **A2A Protocol v0.2.5+**: In-memory, event-driven, for high-performance local agent-to-agent messaging.

## 3. System Overview & Architecture

### 3.1. Multiagent Core
- **Agents**: Modular, specialized, and composable. All inherit from `BaseAgent` and are created via `AgentFactory`.
- **Canonical Interfaces**: `IAgentRegistry`, `IAgentDiscovery`, `IAgentCommunication` enforce all registry, discovery, and messaging.
- **Hybrid Registry/Discovery**: Combines in-memory (A2A) and RESTful (MCP) sources, with MCP as the source of truth for distributed scenarios.
- **Orchestration**: `HybridAgentOrchestrator` coordinates agent selection, task assignment, and advanced features (QuerySkill, dynamic UX, in-task authentication).

### 3.2. Memory System
- **OneAgentMemory**: Canonical, RESTful, and MCP-compliant memory client.
- **mem0 Backend**: Persistent, auditable, and versioned memory store.
- **Memory Intelligence**: Semantic search, embeddings, and context retrieval for agent workflows.
- **Audit Logging**: All critical actions, errors, and decisions are logged for traceability and compliance.

### 3.3. Protocols & Communication
