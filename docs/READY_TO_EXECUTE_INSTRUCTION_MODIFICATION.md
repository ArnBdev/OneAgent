# 🚀 Strategic Instruction Modification - Ready to Execute

*OneAgent Professional Development Platform*  
*System Health: 85.96% | Constitutional AI: Active | BMAD Framework: Ready*

---

## 📋 Immediate Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Backup & Validation (Ready Now)
```powershell
# Execute from OneAgent directory
cd "c:\Users\arne\.cline\mcps\OneAgent"
.\scripts\phase1-backup-validation.ps1
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Creates timestamped backup with integrity validation
- ✅ Tests restore procedure to ensure recoverability  
- ✅ Records system health baseline (85.96%)
- ✅ Confirms Constitutional AI and BMAD framework status
- ✅ Provides emergency restore commands

### Phase 2: Strategic Enhancement (After Phase 1)
```powershell
# Use timestamp from Phase 1 output
.\scripts\phase2-strategic-enhancement.ps1 -BackupTimestamp "YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS"
```

**What this does:**
- 🤖 Adds Multi-Agent Communication Priority section
- 🔗 Enhances Primary Objectives with agent-to-agent focus
- 📋 Integrates multi-agent development workflow
- 🛡️ Preserves Constitutional AI and BMAD frameworks
- ✅ Validates all changes with quality checks

## 🔧 Emergency Procedures

### **If Issues Occur During Phase 1:**
```powershell
# Scripts include automatic error handling and will stop safely
# No restoration needed - original files remain untouched
```

### **If Issues Occur During Phase 2:**
```powershell
# Automatic rollback included in script
# Manual restore if needed:
Copy-Item "$env:APPDATA\Code\User\prompts\.instructions.backup.TIMESTAMP.md" "$env:APPDATA\Code\User\prompts\.instructions.md" -Force
```

### **Verify System Health After Changes:**
```powershell
# Check OneAgent system status
# Use oneagent_system_health tool in VS Code Copilot Chat
```
