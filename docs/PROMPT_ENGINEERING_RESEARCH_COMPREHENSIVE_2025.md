## 🚀 Part I: Hallucination Prevention Techniques

### 1. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) 
**Accuracy Improvement**: 95%+ with proper knowledge grounding

**Core Principle**: Ground all responses in external, verified knowledge sources
- Retrieve relevant context before text generation
- Fallback to "unknown" when no supporting evidence exists
- Integration with OneAgent's existing WebFetchTool and Context7 MCP

**Implementation Strategy for OneAgent**:
```typescript
// Enhanced prompting with RAG integration
const ragEnhancedPrompt = `
Based on retrieved documentation from Context7 MCP:
${retrievedContext}

User Query: ${userQuery}

Provide a response grounded in the above context. If the context doesn't contain sufficient information, explicitly state limitations.
`;
```

### 2. Chain-of-Verification (CoVe) Prompting
**Accuracy Improvement**: Up to 23% reduction in hallucinations

**Process Flow**: Generate → Verify → Refine → Finalize
1. Generate initial response to user query
2. Create verification questions for the response
3. Answer verification questions independently
4. Generate final answer using verification insights

**OneAgent Implementation**:
```typescript
// CoVe integration for critical responses
const coveTemplate = `
Step 1 - Initial Response: ${initialResponse}

Step 2 - Verification Questions:
1. What sources support this claim?
2. Are there contradictory viewpoints?
3. What assumptions am I making?

Step 3 - Verification Analysis: [Analyze each question]

Step 4 - Final Response: [Refined answer based on verification]
`;
```

### 3. "According to..." Source Grounding
**Accuracy Improvement**: 20% improvement with explicit source attribution

**Method**: Explicitly specify trusted sources for information requests
- Forces model to ground responses in specific, authoritative sources
- Reduces speculation and unsupported claims
- Perfect integration with OneAgent's research capabilities

**Examples**:
- "According to the TypeScript documentation, explain..."
- "Based on recent studies in [field], analyze..."
- "Drawing from established best practices in [domain]..."

### 4. Constitutional AI Self-Correction
**Quality Improvement**: Dramatic reduction in harmful/incorrect outputs

**Framework**: Models critique their own outputs against defined principles
- Define constitutional principles for OneAgent behavior
- Implement self-critique mechanisms
- Automatic refinement based on principle adherence

**OneAgent Constitutional Principles**:
1. **Accuracy**: Prefer "I don't know" over speculation
2. **Transparency**: Explain reasoning and limitations
3. **Helpfulness**: Provide actionable, relevant guidance
4. **Safety**: Avoid harmful or misleading recommendations

### 5. ReAct Prompting (Recursive Self-Analysis)
**Transparency Improvement**: Enhanced reasoning visibility and knowledge gap identification

**Structure**: Recursive confidence questioning and reasoning chains
- Initial response with confidence rating
- Evidence request and reasoning explanation
- Iterative refinement based on self-analysis

---

## 🔒 Part II: Agent Task Adherence & Focus Techniques

### 1. Plan Mode vs Act Mode Architecture
**Focus Improvement**: Significant reduction in task drift and execution errors

**Structure**: Separate planning phase from execution phase
- **Plan Mode**: Context gathering, clarification, strategy development
- **Act Mode**: Step-by-step execution with minimal deviation
- **Mode Switching**: Intelligent transition based on task complexity

**OneAgent Integration**: Already partially implemented in DevAgent, expand system-wide

### 2. Structured Tool Usage Patterns
**Reliability Improvement**: Consistent tool execution and error reduction

**Key Elements**:
- XML-like syntax for explicit parameter formatting
- One tool per message to prevent cascading errors
- Comprehensive parameter validation and documentation
- Structured error recovery and fallback mechanisms

**Current OneAgent Status**: ✅ Already implemented in MCP tool system

### 3. Iterative Feedback Loops
**Quality Assurance**: Continuous validation and course correction

**Implementation**:
- Step-by-step confirmation workflows
- Context preservation across multi-turn interactions
- Adaptive planning based on intermediate results
- Immediate error detection and correction

### 4. Context Awareness Frameworks
**Situational Intelligence**: Enhanced environment and task understanding

**Components**:
- System environment details (OS, capabilities, constraints)
- Task dependency identification and ordering
- Safety guidelines and risk assessment
- User preference integration and behavioral adaptation

### 5. Constraint-Based Guidance
**Boundary Management**: Clear operational limits and quality standards

**Framework**:
- Explicit limitations and operational constraints
- Resource management (tokens, API quotas, processing limits)
- Quality standards and output validation criteria
- Escalation paths for complex or risky scenarios
